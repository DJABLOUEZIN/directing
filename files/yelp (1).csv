I can't count the number of times he's talked about Yushoken. Finally got to try it on a vacation back home in Cebu.

I've had plenty of ramen and I can say that this is one of the better ones that I've had, even better than the ramen places in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo! 

The menu is simple and focuses on a tonkotsu broth. To taste the broth I opted for a shio tare. My parents ordered the shoyu, which I was also able to taste. The tonkotsu shined in my shio ramen, with the broth thick and rich enough to cling to the noodles. The chashu is also fatty, buttery and tender. The gyoza were very plump, and more meaty than most gyozas served within the city. Aji tamago was perfectly cooked as well. 

I'm very, very surprised at how everything was prepared close to perfection! After hearing about the ramen craze in the Philippines, I didn't expect the execution to be this good in Cebu after trying some of the hyped ramen places in Manila. At Yushoken, everything surpassed my expectations and more!","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

Blackbeard's is a casual restaurant that is warm and inviting.  By warm I mean the welcome not the temperature.  Thankfully the restaurant is fully air-conditioned so I actually stopped sweating for some time.  It was a welcome respite from the stifling outside temperature.  The look and feel definitely screams island life, which was fitting considering it was my first time back to this island in more than a decade.

I trusted my sister-in-law to order what she thought was best.  The menu was extensive but she went with the Mt. Apo.  This particular order is meant to be shared by 5-7 people.  It has everything that you could imagine.  Crabs, shrimp, squid, chicken prepared two ways, vegetables, rice, and so much more.  This platter came out and I was instantly blown away.  The presentation, the aroma, and the quantity is beyond expectation.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words but in this case no words could adequately describe what was set before me and my fam.  My nephews and I dug right into it and I was instantly transported to food nirvana.  Delicious is an understatement.  I could have eaten everything on that huge platter myself if only my stomach didn't have a finite amount of stretching ability to it.  I knew that my sis-in-law had made the right choice and I couldn't have been any happier.

If you happen to be in Ayala Mall or nearby, don't hesitate to make your way to this place.  Trust me when I say this you will not be disappointed.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

The broth alone is incredibly tasty, and with the noodles and other toppings the ramen here is absolutely delicious. Definitely a must-try here in the city. 

I recommend their miso ramen or their tonkotsu dipping noodles. I've had both in the past. Both have incredibly complex flavors expertly blended into one perfect bowl of ramen. For sides, I suggest gyoza and the karaage. You simply cannot miss the gyoza, and Yushoken does the juiciest and most delicious karaage I've ever had. You can also choose to sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook your meal! 

The place gets a bit busy, so make sure you get there earlier, especially for dinner.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

It's a bit far from Cebu City, but if your in the area and looking for clean, pleasant place to have a nice meal with professional service this is the place. The presentation gives an aura of quality and the ambiance is very pleasant. The cuisine is primarily Japanese and is buffet style but they also offer the ability to barbecue your food, as well as Chinese Dim Sum dishes and the ability to make you own Vietnamese soup noodle dish called Pho. I have also head that they do not use MSG in their cooking since I am not fond of its use and despite that the food is still delicious in IMHO.

During lunch hours, the dessert selection is limited to ice cream, halox2, and taho. But dinner time is when you get the full selection which includes creme brulee.

Its a welcome sight to have a place like this in this part of town. If you are in the area, and are in the mood for asian cuisine specializing in Japanese.. definitely add this place to the list.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

Stumbled upon this place and it piqued my interest when I saw that it was in an area developed by Rockwell, which I've stayed at in Manila. 

The restaurant is set back in a lunch garden across a small pool from a dessert spot. We were greeted and accommodated despite not having a reservation. The ambience of the restaurant was beautiful - modern yet cozy. The restrooms were clean and the servers very polite and attentive. 

The food was delicious. My friend ordered the salmon dish and I order a shrimp pasta. For dessert, the server recommended one of their specials - a tiramisu creatively  plated as a flower in a flower pot with a watering can filled with a delicious white sauce that is to be poured on top. 

The price fit the food and the general feeling and service of the place.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

They provide benches and tables for those who wants to eat there.  But it's outdoor.  They also provide plastic gloves for those who want to use their hands to eat. It's kind of fun because that's something new to me.  In the old days, you just eat with your hands and just wash before and after.  They still provide hand washing center though so no worries.  

Overall, a fun eat.  And a must when you're in town.","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

After almost two and a half weeks in the Philippines and exclusively eating Filipino fare -- I was DYING for a slice of pizza. I was so desperate I was going to suggest going to the Sbarro's or Pizza Hut at the Ayala but luckily my cousin (and Yelp) suggested we check out Handuraw, a local Cebuano favorite.

Thin crust pizza is the game here and when our Handuraw House Special came out I was shocked to see that the pizza looked like it was made on a flimsy ass tortilla. I grabbed a slice, braced myself for the worst and took a bite -- it as surprisingly good! The crust was crunchy and held up to all of the toppings quite nicely. We downed two pizzas with the quickness as well as an order for the chili wings. 

They have a good beer selection and sell gin and juice by the pitcher which is pretty gangsta of them.

As we were finishing up, a local band started playing CCR hits and guess what --- they were amazing. The restaurant is very lively and fun and I'd definitely come back for a thoroughly modern Filipino experience.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

This is coming from someone who's lived and vacationed there, trust me. Do not pass up going to this place when you're in Cebu or if you're planning to go there, this is something that needs to be part of your list. It's not a fancy tourist spot but if you want the full experience and really mix with the locals then you should definitely pay them a visit. Like I said, it's nothing fancy so your wallet shouldn't worry, it comes pretty cheap. I suggest you go here with friends and family because the experience is more fun when you're with a group. 

When we go to Larsian, it's usually out of the blue like we'd wonder where we're gonna eat and someone would suggest Larsian and magically we'd all agree. And it's fun at anytime of the day but since it's an open area / al fresco then night time is the ideal choice!

Where do you go to when you're in Cebu?","","",""

Expect to wait a long time since they cook their food as you order (that would be good since you know that your food is cooked fresh) but for me it was worth it. When I first came here some time ago, my first impression was that their service was quite slow, but in the end it was worth the wait since their food is pretty good and tasty. Authentic Indian cuisine indeed and you get to choose whether you want it spicy, medium, or mild. As for me, I always opt for spicy since I can handle the heat. I got the naan bread which was good paired with their chicken tikka masala. The chicken tikka masala was delicious especially if you mix it with their biryanis. I usually go for their vegetable biryani since I already ordered a meat dish (chicken tikka masala) and you also get to choose whether you want it spicy, medium, or mild as well. I don't usually order drinks since they give you a pitcher of ice cold water for free, and it's refillable too. Overall it's a good place to eat if you're into and looking for authentic Indian cuisine. The only downside of this place is that you need to wait long for your order to arrive but the food is definitely worth it. I've been here a few times already and the food doesn't disappoint.","","",""

After Anthony Bourdain claimed that Zubuchon had the best lechon in all of Philippines, I knew I had to try. We walked in around 11am and saw that they just received their delivery of the whole pig (we were also told they receive it twice a day). Knowing that this pork will be as fresh as it comes, we placed an order for zubuchon lechon. The orders go by weight of how much lechon you want and because we just had breakfast, we ordered the smallest order.

The order also comes with a side of rice, a small side of a ginger salad mix, vinegar and soy sauce, which is a perfect combo for a lunch size portion. Now, onto the meat. Let me preface this by saying that I'm not the biggest pork consumption eater but this had to be the most succulent pork I've ever had with the crispiest crackling skin. Color me impressed. My friend, who's a local said that lechon is usually eaten with a special dark sauce similar to hoisin so we requested that on the side and it complimented the pork well, cutting through the saltiness.

The interior was clean and there are plenty of tables to situate yourself in. I'm glad I was able to try Zubuchon's claim to fame and implore you to try it out as well!","","",""

The good:
- the service was attentive and generous
- the decor is on point. Its a great location for a celebration
- the location is very easy to find and access
- the concept of an open market preparing fresh seafood is amazing

The bad
- for me ( and only for me) the flavors were off. Every preparation  came our sweet. The garlic wasnt garlicy at all, the spicy chili was sweet and sour sauce, the plain steam was bleh. 
- im going to say that the seafood quality was questionable. Other than the large crab that i purchased at a high additional cost every thing else was definitely  not fresh. The meat was hard to get out of the shell and it was severly overcooked...almost like it had been precooked. I selected shrimp which were alive but what arrived at my table was long dead.

Talk about good timing. We decided to meet up at The Terraces (inside Ayala Center) which has an endless option of food, coffee and bubble tea spots. Hukad looked good for Filipino food so we gave them a try.

We dropped in on a Wednesday evening (around 9:00pm) and it was busy. Lots of tables, inside and outside, to choose from and friendly service. 
 
The menu is split into appetizers, soup, seafood platters, meat, rice, veggies, sweets and drinks.

- 2x Garlic rice (48 PHP) - this took awhile to come out so they scooped us some steamed rice (on the house) to go with the other dishes that had arrived. It was worth the wait. Really tasty, prominent garlic flavour.
- Cowrie pinakbet (119 PHP) - apparently, we got the very last order. Good flavours; I got a hint of shrimp/seafood paste and spiciness. Vegetables were a welcome sight to see.
- Tuna belly (235 PHP) - they were out of squid so we settled on a piece of tuna. Nicely grilled, tender and a good portion size.

This was surprisingly good for mall eats!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

They have a nice variety of choices for breakfast.  Of course there are plenty of Filipino food such as Cebu Longanisa, dried fish, suman, and pan de sal.  There are also western choices such as little pancakes and waffles.  

I think their signature item is the Ube Champorado.  If you are a Filipino, then you must try it cause it is super yummy!!!!  If you are a foreigner, then I highly suggest trying it too.  I had never seen ube flavored champorado before that morning.  I am used to the traditional chocolate flavored champorado.  What is Champorado?  Traditionally, it is a chocolate flavored rice porridge.  I love eating it with dried salted fish cause it the perfect combination of sweetness and saltiness!  

My favorite item from their buffet was their Ensaymada.  I ate so many of their mini ensaymadas!  They were soft, round, sugary, and topped with cheese.  I loved their version of this traditional Filipino pastry/bread.

We enjoyed the buffet at Providore.  Service was top notch.  The restaurant was very clean.  I recommend them.","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

Who is also known for baking excellent wedding cakes!

I was thrilled to know she is opening a cafe as it would mean easy access to her cakes lol i love the texture of the pastries she makes and one of my favorites is their classic chocolate cake. It is not too sweet, icing is made smooth and delicate and texture is just right. The green tea and sesame cake had a chiffon-cake texture but surprisingly it blended pretty well with the icing/mousse that it was such a joy to eat.

I can't say much for the coffee as i havent tried it but i bet they are pretty good as well. I expected nothing but the best from Trina. Treat Street is definitely worth trying!

Update: i've finally tried their coffee after 2 years! Lol coffee was solid with a nice frothy cream. Very good in my opinion.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

I even told the Owner Tom I was a Big Critic from Los Angeles. We ordered burgers well done and they came medium with red in the middle. For some reason Filipino burgers can not stay together.  They just aren't firm enough like L.A. Burgers. The meat seems to always fall apart. The bread was great. If you ask for a regular burger plate it will not come with lettuce or tomato which is completely standard. The Fries portion is a tease and it left me wanting McDonald huge fries. In short I was very disappointed and know now that perfect burgers in the Phillipines just do not exist. The place is very neat and nicely decorated but I will definitely stick to Fried Chicken in the Phillipines....","","",""

The lechon was rediculously good!!!  Soft inner meat and the crunchiness of the skin was out of this world.  The meat just melts in your mouth.  Ive never had such good lechon in the states.  I was blown away with it and it wasent even too salty.  I can see from the lechon why they were so busy.  The spicy one wasent spicy at all...
The fried calamari and squid adobo were ok.  They werent amazing like the lechon.   The soup was good in that it cleansed your pallet and the warmth from it helps to breakdown the fattiness of the lechon.
The garlic fried rice was good.  It easily fed 7 people a good amount of rice.  There was a hint of garlic and it played well to the overall meal.
The vegetables were good in that it provided you with less guilt knowing that you had your serving of vegetables.
Baked scallops were lathered in too much cheese and the flavor of the seafood was lost, which was meh....
Also had a coconut juice which was so refreshing.  Eating all that protein in the hot environment, the coconut juice was a nice finish to the meal. 

Overall im glad i dont live close by to this place.  Because the taste and texture of the lechon is dangerous to my arteries and waistline.   But i enjoyed every bite of this rich rich meal.  Cebu did not disappoint with ther lechon!!!","","",""

Decor:  The first thing that sold me on this place was the ambiance and the look.  It literally had me turning my head every which way to make sure I didn't miss something hanging on the walls or posted on a shelf.  It was beautiful.  While I was alone, I could see how this spot would be perfect for date night.

Food:  I went on a sunday evening, so there were 2 for 1 margaritas and discounts on some of the dips/salsa.  I had the queso fundido which was pretty much a cheese and jalapeno dip.  It was very melty and had a great flavor.  It is very thick and most of my chips broke in the dip, but since I was alone I didn't mind digging right in with my fork.  I also ordered the brisket tacos.  They were decent but not great.  The brisket was a little tough for my liking.  I prefer my brisket a little more tender.  The top seller was a pork option, but I was over eating pork at this point.

Service:  Like most places in the Philippines, service is not the same as in the USA.  I never had a dedicated waiter/waitress that came over and asked me what I wanted.  I always had to get someone's attention and tell them that I was ready to order or if I had questions.  I don't say this as a negative, just something I noticed throughout the country.  It didn't bother me but if you aren't used to it you may think you are being ignored.  However, when you are able to talk to staff they are VERY PLEASANT.  Great experience.  

Sidenote:  Sundays are also salsa night after 9.  There were tons of people there salsa dancing the night away.  It captivated me more and added to the ambiance of the restaurant.  Definitely a date night top pick.","","",""

So far this place does not disappoint. My favorite is their spicy humba. It tastes like a really good home cooked meal. I like how they took that old-aged recipe and made it a  little special by adding that spicy sesame oil! YUM! Their salads were also a big hit for me but maybe a 7 out of 10 because i've had better ones before.

The ambiance is very simple and laid back. You won't be expecting to get such tasteful dishes at mere glance & most probably the only reason you dared to try it out is because you've heard too many good things about their food that you simply can't let it pass by.

Their service is not that good. It's not bad but I think they can surely do much better. I say they improve a little on their service, add more to their dessert menu & they're set for the next 10yrs. 

It's not easy to give yourself a name that you can't live up to but EVERYTHING YUMMY is indeed everything yummy!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

The pricing seemed reasonable but take note I prefer bigger meals. For dessert, I tried the leche flan tempura. Might try different dessert next time, since I would have preferred the flan to be room temp. it seemed to be on the cold side, despite the frying.

The must haves were Relyenlong Talong, a Filipino eggplant omelette and the Kuya J's Bulalo, which is a beef bone soup. Unfortunately they were out of the kare kare, so we were not able to sample that. The omelette was by far my favorite, it was nice and crispy on the top side and the underside was the soft eggplant. For the beef soup, the broth was superb! We also tried the lumpia - which was disappointingly salty - and also the sisig fried rice. The only reason we got the fried rice was because they charge plain white rice per head.

The pizza are good and you can select your own toppings and make your own pizza but somehow there is something lacking and I can't figure it out. Also the taste of the food is forgettable.
I can't actually remember if it was good or not. 

Normally I can easily finished a 14 inch size pizza on my own but in this case I only had a few slices.

Cabahug St. at the Bonifacio District Retail Center. If you're coming from the Ayala Mall area it'll be on your left on that street after the curve.

Upon entering we were greeted, loudly, then promptly seated. We ordered the Pork Cutlet Curry and I believe the Chicken Curry as well. As I browsed through the menu I did not notice they had naan but didn't say if they the garlic cheese naan that I ordered back in Japan. Anywho since we had time to kill, why not get online while waiting for our food. Uhh well, they only had wifi for the ""admin"" the waitress said. ""Bummer!"" I thought. So we waited for awhile for our food.  I decided to head on over to the restroom to wash my hands. Upon entering the restroom smelled good, like the shampoo from Daiso in Japan. However, the hid the toilet paper behind the mirror. Pretty Odd! The bidet toilet was disgusting. Who on earth would even use that bidet in that condition. Also, the toilet was right infront of the sink so if someone was not careful they would end up hitting their head on the sink. Since it was a unisex restroom the men's urinal was comfortably situated on the other side, which I believe for obvious reasons should have been placed on the other side, where the bidet is. But anyway I washed my hands and left.

Food arrived and it smelled and tasted similar to the ones in Japan. The downfall?! I believe their pork cutlet is frozen. The outer part was crispy and hot but the inside was a bit chewy and not as hot. So I'm assuming it was previously frozen. Anyway the curry was authentic and matched the seasoning and flavoring to the branches in Japan. When Inwas in Japan I don't recall having the option to choose rice portion size. So I thought that was kinda weird too. Different price points for different rice portion sizes and different kind of rice. We opted for their combo which included ice cream and a drink. Ice cream and the little fruits in it was good. 

Staff: Throughout our time there various employees were just standing around chit chatting, playing tag with each other, and I believe someone from management sitting at the counter watching movied on their phone. I know there weren't many patrons but I don't think it pleasing to watch employees just randomly doing whatever they want. Anyway our waitress was good her service was acceptable.

Overall, I think if you haven't visited coco ichibanya in Japan than this is a way to try it out. Would I come back to this particular one again? Probably not. The establishment itself looks nice and neat, the bathroom ehh yucky. I just wish that the pork wasn't initially frozen because it was soo chewy, like it was flash fried or something. Curry was good.

Well, the pizza was very good at that time so I went back quite a few times over the years.  I am now seeing that they have a pretty substantial branch of burritos and other Mexican items I would expect.  They also have some classic Filipino food as well.

Starting off with cold cuts, it tasted good. The second was soup - and it was served cold! That was a disappointing start to the meal. Singapore style chili crab, while the most expensive (almost 3k for a kilo of shriveled crab), tasted average and wasn't very flavorful.

The buchi balls smelled bad off the fryer. But they did quite well on cha misua, fried lapu-lapu, and Peking duck that we ordered. 

Service is always good, but the kitchen can be very slow to serve. A little on the pricey side, but Cebuanos now have little choice for Chinese seafood restaurants since Choi closed too. Tao Yuan is probably the best from the Manila imports.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

The prices are very reasonable and variety is good. However, the service has place for improvement.

If you come as a group and order individually, they can bring food to only one person first, leaving others having to stare at the lucky one. Or they can bring the main dish before the soup or appetizer. And even desert before the main meal. 

They don't know that the drinks should be served first, so expect your drinks when you are finishing your meal. 

They waiters are nice and eager to help, but I think the lack of proper training brings the rep of this restaurant down.","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

Service was great and we were quickly seated. The waiter and waitress were eager and pleasant when it was time to order.

We ordered 2 pho specials (comes with meatball, literally just the one, beef and tendon, but no tripe. Waitress didn't know what tripe was either) small, one viet coffee ( I said cafe sua da and the waitress didn't know what I was talking about ) and bottled water. We have a spot we frequent back in the States for pho, so this wasn't our first time. I waited patiently for the bean sprout plate they normally hand out before you get your pho but then I noticed written on their wall that they include everything for you in your pho. uhmm ok. So we got our order and the first thing I normally do is take a sip of the broth. Yeah it's not authentic pho for sure. I guess maybe it' their own twist but a Filipino version? Idk, but nothing compares to the broth at Pho Bang in Garland,Texas, so we're pretty spoiled when it comes to pho. The meatball wasn't made like the Viet places we frequent back home, and the taste was also lacking. It was nice that they added the basic cilantro to their pho as I believe cilantro in general is hard to find in dishes here in the Philippines. I like alot of bean sprouts in my pho and I like to add the mint leaves in as well. We didn't have that choice. The viet coffee was ok, I requested extra condense milk. 

Overall the service was great, no complaints at all. The food.. well it was meh, I would have liked some authentic flavored viet pho and wheres the tripe? If we come back maybe we'll try their bahn mi and see how that works out.

Tip: They have no restroom in their restaurant nor a sink to wash your hands. Instead, they were nice enough to hand me some purel. They also accept credit cards.","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

When you ask Cebuanos where to get the BEST, CnT Lechon is the first lechon place they will recommend to tourists. It is meaty, less fatty, juicy and cheaper without sacrificing taste.

When we had lunch here, the lechon was sold out; a true testament of how good the food was. We had to wait for the next batch to arrive. To avoid the crowd/line, we pre-ordered 1Kg of lechon + a plate of Chopsuey (just to give balance to our meal) for 5 people. The one thing I like about CnT lechon is the crispy skin! Make sure you have a piece of skin with the juicy, soft and tender meat. Eat it together with rice and a dab of the dipping sauce (a mixture of vinegar/soy sauce/chili) - you won't stop till you eat every single piece of meat!

One reason why many prefer CnT is because of the price. The price of lechon ranges between Php2800 to Php4500 depending on the size of your whole roasted pig. You can also order it per kilo for only Php320. On our last day, we decided to bring some lechon for our loved ones. We bought 2Kg of lechon then added Php20 for the sealed box. :)

You may want to add other items like sinigang, chicharon, lumpia or just focus on the lechon. Don't hesitate to eat with your hands! :D","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

One complaint I'll get out the way is to make the Lechon hotter (temperature) and maybe add more skin. Its something you can fix with a simple request but I'm low maintenance. 

Came here with a lovely date that doesn't mind packing it in. Had the cheese stick appetizer that I'm sure American foreigners won't forget.

Mixed veggies, serving of Lechon, scallops , some fruit drinks = happy me

They have an indoor room I think you can reserve, so if you want the ultimate A/C comfort with good food then call in. The tourist buses usually take them all.

Mix this experience with waterfalls, deep diving in warm waters, and blue and free scenery and you'll want to move to Cebu","","",""

Owned by Mr. Bong Suda (R.I.P), he used to be the head chef of Kukai Japanese Restaurant before, but he eventually left and decided to open his own restaurant instead. The owner, Mr. Bong Suda (R.I.P) is one of the pioneers in Japanese cuisine here in Cebu. He has been one of the best Japanese chefs in Cebu. From what I hear, he is highly regarded and praised by other Japanese chefs and people here as he is the one who basically started the trend(Japanese cuisine) and make it boom. Ever since Mr. Suda was gone, his son decided and currently is in Japan doing some studying/training in order to follow in his father's footsteps. His wife, Mrs. Carmen Suda, is the one who manages the restaurant while his apprentice is the one cooking for the restaurant now.

They start every meal with these long crackers and an addictive salsa. Not sure how chopped tomato, capsicum (peppers) and onion with olive oil can taste so good. 

Notable mentions must go to their forty chicken - very small but delicious chicken cooked with 40 cloves of garlic and butter. Oreo crepe and their frozen layered dessert were also very nice. 

All pastas ordered were al dente and very garlicky. You just like garlic if you go to Philippines! Attentive service, coffees were not bad, wines were cheap at 150 peso per glass.

Upon reading their menu I was a bit skeptical of the quality and portion size of their ramen as advertised 150 pesos for any of their ramen bowls. I ordered the tonkotsu and I must say it was satisfying (I mean, what one would expect in terms of portion for that price). They did add some type of mushroom that isn't a familiar ingredient and when taking a bite of it, left me remembering a chinese restaurant instead. Otherwise, the broth was neutral not too salty. They also offered combo items that included gyoza but I just opted for the ramen itself with sprite.

Restaurant was clean. Staff was quick, food came out just as quick as. Piping hot. I was pleasantly surprised by the value and the quality of their food. At 150 pesos not bad at all.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

Parking is limited if you want to park right up front of the restaurant. When you pull into City Times Square, head on over to the garage area pass Liv, take a right then another right and you'll arrive at Buffet 101's open air parking area. 

We made a reservation because we were a party of 16 and it was a Saturday for a 6 pm seating. We arrived and a receptionist seated us. It was a Saturday night and as expected, crowded. As the rest of the group was still situating themselves with seating arrangements I went ahead and browsed their offerings. In one end, they offered a variety of Asian-themed food. Sushi, Japanese omelette, tempura to live shrimp cooked to order and of course, Filipino dishes. They had different kinds of soups and even congee. The middle area consisted of a small salad bar, desserts, and beverages. For those who are wondering, they do have beer on tap. Not sure the brand though. They also had sangria (wine). 

On to the other end of the buffet. I frequented this area as they offered roast beef, chicken and pork. I was told they had lamb as well. They had mashed potatoes, a diy sandwhich area, pizza, and pasta to just name a few. After browsing I grabbed a plate. I started with the roast beef in medium and pizza. Later, I went for the mashed potatoes. Fyi: ask your server for the steak knife, if your in need of one. They also had a station for cook to order seafood.

Staff: The waiters and waitresses were all very quick to please. Once you requested something a few moments later they would arrive with your requested item, promptly. Though at times you had to flag one of them down, it is to be expected at a buffet. The birthday singing at each birthday celebrant's table was absolutely entertaining. 

Cost: We did their birthday promo and there were a few in the group celebrating their birthday month. Paying adults are at 839 pesos each on a Saturday night. (Dinner seating) Their birthday promo allows the celebrant to complimentary dine given they had 3 paying adults in their group.

Overall: Despite having to always hunt down in finding a plate for each go at the buffet, the overall experience at Buffet 101 was fantastic. I won't deny we came on a expectation that the service would be sub par, due to various other reviews mentioning this. However, we were delightly surprised that our first experience here was enjoyable. The food, especially the roast beef and grilled salmon, were delicious and seasoned just right. If Buffet 101 wasn't a ways from where we stay, I'd definitely visit again even if it isnt for a special occasion. No wifi. Free Parking. Restrooms were clean, but had an odor.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

We showed up around 4:30 PM and hung out at the  pool area for about an hour, waiting for the buffet to open up.

We ordered a few drinks and some enseymadas to snack on, which I was told they are known for at this place.  I thought they were pretty good, but not wow'ed by it.  We got both the mango and ube flavors, but I only got to try the ube so I can't comment on the mango flavor.

My fresh young coconut juice was nicely cut so that you can drink it with a straw and then open the top to scoop out the coconut meat later, which I didn't get to enjoy.

We ended up going into the buffet area around 5:30 PM because the house next door was burning some woods or something, but it smelled terrible so our eyes were watering.

The buffet actually opens up at 6:30 PM so we just sat around and chatted until they opened up.

Service was actually very friendly and accommodating.

The food on the other hand was just ok.

The seafood selection didn't seem too fresh, even though I was told that this place serves the best.

My daughter really enjoyed the lechon, which I thought was kind of salty.

Nothing really stood out for me, but I thought their dessert arrangement was very pretty.

I tried the flan which was ok, but it wasn't as soft as I'm used to.

The chocolate mousse was good though.","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

The dinner lechon was re- fried, dry and not good at all.  The lechon is supposed to be from carcar, the well known area for lechon/chicharon.  It's also Cebu lechon which is famous for lechon. However, I'm sad to report that it definitely falls flat from any expectation of a good lechon.

Anyway, it's a nice looking place, food portions are on the smaller side.","","",""

Because we come here so often, we almost forget that his restaurant is supposed to be Chinese than Filipino.

As always, their most popular dish is their steamed rice. It's not just rice that's steamed lol and i mention that because when i first came to America i was so excited to see ""steamed rice"" on the menu only to find out that it was just how they cook the rice. Here in harbour city, it comes with a pork sauce or gravy. You can't go wrong with it. Now, you also have the option to make it spicy.

In this particular chain, they always serve food dim sum style so they always have the cart around. Other dishes we usually go for is their fried lumpia, and the oooh sooo good siomai with quails egg. So far, no one else make steamed rice and siomai with quails eggs like harbour city. Their prices have gone high over the years though and without change in serving size. Cost of living sucks but it is what it is. It's always a pleasure eating here and I doubt I'd get tired of the place yet. 

Keep in mind this is no fancy restaurant and is almost, if not, the same as Dimsum Break. Either way, it's still a go to place for steamed rice.","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

It's their sauce on their Pai Kuat, chicken feet, siomal quall eggs, steamed chicken. Their garlic pork spare ribs is very yummy. This place NEVER gets old. They have many branches all over Cebu so they're easy to locate. We prefer this place over Harbour City dimsum when it comes to food flavor and seasoning.

They're located on 3rd floor, near the bowling alley, I tried editing the address but whoever at yelp is changing my post is not paying attention. 

We always dine on this branch as it is in the  mall and close to our place. Their space used to be big, they've shrunk and now it's hard to find a spot on peak hours. 

They take credit card but because of spotty internet connection, better bring cash.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

That was my first order of business after landing. Of course I've eaten it before and even made it myself, but all of my Filipino friends say that it's best in country.

This restaurant was very busy and popular. A good (and healthy) sign I've noticed in less developed countries. The Decour reminded me of Island life and was very well staffed, no dish left uncovered slash/no water dropping below half/someone always at your beckon call.

I ordered the smallest lechon dish and soon realized it was too much for one person. I want to say it was at least one pound of pork and came with garlic rice. I paired it nicely with sweetened calamansi juice, which perfectly cleansed my palate before and after the meal. I would've drank a second glass of that juice if possible! 

It's doubtful I'll ever be in Cebu again, but if I were and I wanted lechon this would be the place. Only 4 stars because this place is a bit overpriced.","","",""

They serve authentic Filipino cuisine at Laguna Garden Cafe.  None of that Fusion stuff!  No foreign food on the menu either.  If you are looking for a burger or lasagna, then you will have to look elsewhere.  Go ahead and order what you want.  Literally, everything we've ordered has tasted delicious.  Don't forget to try their desserts and drinks too!!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

What a treat to eat food of this quality after traveling around enjoying more rustic fare.
The prawns are a standout for me. The gnocchi with chicken thighs was delicious BUT became entirely too sweet once the caramelized onions were discovered. Completely not needed in this dish.
Beet salad 9/10
Cauliflower 8/10 best to share as it is quite rich 
60' lava cake 9/10 would prefer coconut ice cream to the salted caramel
Croquettes 8/10 needed a bit more salt. The aioli helps.
As a solo diner, I ate in front of the kitchen one night and the other in the side room. I would not recommend the side room. Felt isolated and with larger groups or children, way too loud. The bar would have been better.

Service was above reproach.

There aren't many ramen shops in Cebu that make a decent ramen. So it's a lil exciting for Cebuanos when they come across one. Yushoken is one of the few places that offer decent ramen. The place has a decent amount of tables, but expect to wait for seating at peak hours. Yushoken is widely known in Cebu as the best ramen shop, and this isn't really something I can argue against. But then again, there's also not a lot of competition. I got to try their Tantanmen and Shoyu. I had nothing I could think of to better their broth, and the noodles were cooked just right. The dishes just lacked the complexity that I expected based on the price. You even had to pay an extra 80 pesos in order to have an egg in your ramen. Something that should've been included in the first place. But the ramen themselves tasted great and I would agree that they have the best in Cebu. In my ratings though, I take into account the price. In this case, Yushoken gets one star off because I would say that it wasn't worth the prices.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

The restaurant was about half full, we were quickly seated at a booth and given a few minutes to browse the menu.  We ended up ordering a little of both the original and the spicy lechon (smallest grams of each), some sauteed ong choy, and some garlic rice.  The food came out pretty quickly which was a good thing as my buddy and I were starving.  I saw calamansi juice on the menu so I knew I had to order that since it was our last dinner during our week long dive trip in Malapascua.

If you can handle a bit of heat, I definitely would recommend the spicy lechon as the perfectly roasted suckling pork was mixed with a spicy and citrusy soy sauce which added a ton of flavor.  The skin was perfectly crispy and the lechon had the perfect fat/meat balance.  The sauteed ong choy was also perfectly sauteed and seasoned and the dab of hot sauce added a nice little kick to the dish. Every meal while in the Philippines should be done with garlic rice as it's tasty as hell.  The iced calamansi juice was super refreshing and hit the spot on a warm night.

Wished we had dined here before heading to Malapascua to start our trip as this was the best meal we had all week long.  As have mentioned, the halo halo isn't like your traditional shaved ice but instead an ube milk shake which was good but having the traditional dessert would've been better.  

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area.","","",""

We also ordered sisig and it was also kind of disappointing where it was not crunchy at all. It was like eating fatty pork served on a sizzling pan. 

I think my most favorite dish was the vegetables, which tells you a lot. Also my Ube drink was not bad. The only reason I would give it three stars is because of their interior and the comfort of the restaurant. I also like the fact that they gave you a banana leaf as a plate.

It's quite fancy, minus the table cloth.  They have a ginormous (hahaha) dining area both indoors and outdoor. We dined here for Valentine's Day. Their Lechon (roasted pig cooked underground covered with banana leaves) was surprisingly, delicious! It literally melted in our mouth! Another favorite of ours was their freshly made mango shake. I think they used more than three fresh mangos per glass which was fantastic.  It was so good.

I can understand why the locals come here for their special events. Service was great, and of course being Valentine's Day, we had a romantic dinner style.

Cheers!","","",""

For 5 star Restaurant they were out of 3 first choices for dinner, waitress was not professional at all.
My wife had fish and there was a paper wrapper in it, waitress explained sorry chef left it in it never offered to take it and replace it.
Had ordered a birthday cake and it was delayed and sent to wrong table, my meal was tasteless.
Waitress was never really trained to work in a five star restaurant, when asked for manager waited 15 minutes and was told not there then asked for Hotel manager and after 15 minutes Restaurant Magerer showed up.
Yes they took off the two bad meals but entire experience was terrible","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

This delicious cafe serves silogs and other foods and cakes, but we came here for breakfast. Early risers also come here to just chill in this clean eatery which has a chill homey ambience. It was definitely a good experience as we had tocilog bowls which were very tasty and filling. The coffee and iced tea is also great here for a pick-me-up in the am. I liked that the location was also low-key.

Lots of seating and tables.
CR available.
Great breakfast/brunch spot.

First things first, when you get seated, you get this piece of paper where you can fill up and select your preferred ramen, noodle texture, saltiness, and other add-ons including side orders. For those who prefer non-noodle dishes, they have those as well, like the mini donburi. As for me, I ordered the Tonkotsu Special with extra menma(bamboo shoot) and seaweed. The soup was flavorful and the noodles was cooked to my preferred liking. I got the chicken karaage as well, it was crispy, juicy, and cooked to perfection! Overall the meal was pretty good as expected. Too bad the gyoza wasn't available that time but their karaage was good.

We chose the all meats deal that comes with pork,  chicken & beef with rice, vegetables & soup for two for less than 400 pesos.. quite a deal in my opinion. 

Soup was first served that was watered down to much for my taste. 

Steamed rice was next which was most certainly a very low grade of rice.

Vegetables were served next that was bland and tasteless,  even after adding soy sauce the taste was just not right. 

Next came the three meats that we choose to have with chili since they were kind enough to ask what our preference was.  As expected from the previous items served all three were bland and tasteless,  we were so surprised that meet covered in sauce could be this depressing on our taste buds and as for the chili I couldn't taste any and I'm very sensitive to chili and spices. 

We decided to leave before even finishing 1/4 of the meal and got some pizza. 

Hope they can make some changes because this would be a great option to the normal choices around the malls in Cebu.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

There was hardly any delectable looking pasty available on their shelf however in fairness to them, they do have good blueberry cheesecake. Drinks are okay but not something I would be craving for.

If not for its location, which is by Sykes and being that they are the only cafe nearby with a rooftop, i doubt this place would've survived until today.

The first time this past summer I got nervous and the guys assisting with the ziplining cheered me on, and again the next day when I finally ziplined. It is such a fun place up in the mountainous area of Cebu. The price is very reasonable, I believe we only paid 250 pesos per person to zipline (you could never pay that low in the USA). The experience and scenery is incomparable - it will always be such a peaceful memory to me. The menu in the cafe is also pretty tasty - I forgot to take photos as it was so hot out, I couldn't really focus. That is the only downfall is there is no A/C in the cafe but if you are familiar with the area - that is already a commonality. I hope more visitors review so this spot can get the attention it deserves however they did seem to keep a pretty steady flow of customers.

Sunday night - Latin dance night, mainly salsa, bachata and kizomba.  Not sure about the classes, as I got there after 10:00 pm and there wasn't any... so if you plan to go for classes, maybe call in advance to confirm?  

Ambience/Decor - OMG, this place is just lovely!  I dragged my two teenage sons with me mainly for dinner, but also because I wasn't going to leave them in the hotel...  Anyhow - my older son was soooo impressed with the place!  Quite frankly, for restaurant/bar standards, it is a 5/5!  There are two levels.  Upstairs is the music/dance/restaurant, downstairs is a little more quiet for date night I guess

Food - Okay, okay... I live in Southern California where Mexican food is bountiful.  Unfortunately, this is the one place it lagged.  Food was alright, but it's hard to compete when I am used to authentic Mexican right around my neighborhood.  I would rate 3.5 stars.  Props though for trying.

Drinks - yes, I had the BOGO margarita.  It was so/so.  But can't pass up for the price. 

Service - Like the other Yelper mentioned, service is not something common or expected in much of the Philippines.  Including this place. 

Location - I believe it's in a little plaza called ""Crossroads"".  There is convenient parking.  But beware - there are plenty (and very enticing) other food choices in this joint.  However, since I came for the dance floor, I was satisfied.","","",""

The bowl you receive could be considered ""snack-sized"" and at P90 for the traditional meats, with the seafood fluttering just above P100, this bowl is such a tasty bargain. I've never had beef sisig, so that's what I went for while my friend went for the pork. The beef did have extra pieces of veggies in it. Both meats were seasoned and marinated well, that prominent citrusy-sour flavor made possible by a heavy dose of calamansi. The meat wasn't extraordinary in size, nor was it crunchy or sizzling, but the combined ingredients -- along with the rice and gooey egg added on top -- made for a delicious bowl.

It's a really nice establishment overall; nice dining area, service and ambience. We arrived after a long day of traveling, and this was the first and only place we wanted to try that night for dinner.

Special Carcar Lechon: very cute presentation with the wooden plate shaped like a pig. It was flavorful and nicely salted, the meat itself wasn't bad. The skin wasn't crispy like you'd expect, it was almost chewy? 

Grilled Tuna Belly: pretty good, really large portion and well seasoned! It's a very meaty fish, so make sure you and your friends have the stomach space to indulge in this.

Crispy Chicken Skin: not too memorable

Kinilaw Fiesta: nicely balanced dish in terms of salty/sweet/spicy.

A birthday celebration. Bai Hotel is located right off Ouano Ave. We pulled up and parked in the garage down below.

The buffet (Cafe Bai) is located on the 2nd floor. Once you get off and out the elevator, the receptionists are just ahead. We arrived about 12:30 to 12:45 and was told to take a seat. By now I'm thinking maybe it's packed. So we waited. 1 pm came and we were seated. Entering Cafe Bai, patrons were sparse. I suppose because it was lunch time?! Anywho we were seated in the far left back, right across their beverage station.

So off we went. I grabbed a plate and started browsing around. I first started with the roast beef, siomai, and pork belly. Roast beef tasted well, chewy but not dry.  Siomai was okay. The pork belly still had its crunch and it was seasoned similar to the lechons Carcar is known for. Tasted great! Second round, went back again for another helping of roast beef but this time stopped by the roasted chicken offering to pick up 2 spoon-full of roasted potatoes. Added some cheese and a dinner roll with some black olives. Walked passed the tempura and grabbed a few. Wife said that she noticed the shrimp tempura hidden behind the counter so she had to ask for some. Picked up some sushi as well. Meh. A little dry. I had to water down their lemonade as it was on the sweet side. Think lemonade concentrate, yeah, water it down. They also offered San Miguel beer on tap, coffee, tea, and some canned beverages found in various fridges around the dining area. For dessert, I had bread pudding and various other sweet desserts offered. They also had a halo halo station. Bread pudding was good only there was a skin-like texture which felt weird when eating. Vanilla sauce is available but no whiskey/bourbon/rum sauce that commonly accompanies bread pudding in the south (ie: Texas or Lousiana) *winks*

Staff: Staff was pleasant from the receptionists to the waiters and waitresses. Their birthday cheer was cool too. Great service. Asked a waiter and waitress to take a picture of us and they were very accommodating.

Restroom: Clean. Toilet bowls were tiny, like ones on an airplane. 

Overall: It is what you would expect from a hotel buffet, only this hotel offered more of an exceptional service than some of its competitors. Security guards bowed entering and exiting the hotel. I don't remember if there was free wifi, I forgot to check. Parking was free. It was a good experience, I left full. 

Tip: The person who made the reservation used the eatigo app to get a promo rate for the buffet. I believe the total bill came to be about 3,500 pesos excluding tip for 6 adults. I'm estimating.","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

The restaurant has a wine cellar with a deli next door.  There are television sets to watch a game, wifi connectivity for folks that want to catch up on work while having a drink or a meal.  The food options were interesting and I ordered the seafood paella.  The rest of the folks ordered other local dishes and sandwiches.  All the food tasted good.

Service was a bit slow and we had to call for service a couple of times.  Parking is available right outside and the security guard will help getting out on the road.

Pricing : Moderate

Will I return? : Maybe, when I am back in Cebu.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

We initially called to reserve a table but they stated they were fully booked but they also accept walk-in guests. So we headed out and arrived about 7-ish pm. We approached the host and they gave us a number. We glanced up at the number being served.. 35 then looked at our number, 71. We decided to wait and it wasn't really a bad wait either. About an hour later our number was called.

We were a party of seven and we were seated near the meat carving area. Upon entering the restaurant it took me back to the time we went to Las Vegas and their buffets at the casino resorts there. It had the same ambiance with about the same amount of customers with friendly waiters and waitresses, quick too, if I may add. I took a walk around to see what they offered. A good variety ranging from Chinese, Filipino, American, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, a salad area, and desserts galore. I decided I would have a go at the meat carving station, ordered a steak at medium well, a portion of chicken and tasted some lamb too. Both the steak and lamb were a bit chewy but seasoned well. The chicken was good. I had mashed potatoes for my side on my first plate and added some garlic sauce on top. Just right for me! mmm. They have a beverage section where you can try out different flavored agua frescas, san miguel beer on tap and you can also get Heineken in a bottle neck. I believe they also offered wine, coffee, and tea.

Dessert ranged from ice cream to rice pudding, churos, small bite sized cakes, fruit salad, and bread pudding with a choice of chocolate or vanilla syrup. The bread pudding was soo good I went back twice. 

Price for dinner: 838 pesos per person
Birthday celebrant is complimentary with other paying adults in your party present. Must bring I.D.

Overall, I will frequent this buffet for special occasions. They have one of the best promotions, price is just right for the variety and quality of food that they offer. Service was great as well!","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

A pork lover, when he visited the Philippines, he had to try 2 very important Pinoy dishes: Sisig and Lechon (Roasted Pig). His hosts served him Zubuchon Lechon and, after eating the best parts of the pig, said his famous line: ""Best pig...ever!"" Of course, that sealed the deal for Zubuchon and everyone wanted a taste of their lechon. So, when I visited Cebu for the first time in 10 years, this was one of the first restaurants I had to try! :) 

Before I ate at Zubuchon, my Cebuano friends recommended other lechon places like CnT or Rico's Lechon. For me, I think Zubuchon's lechon is Excellent! The first time I had Zubuchon, it was during the pig delivery time. I swear, the smell of that pig made me drool! I ordered a 1/2 kilo and ate every piece of meat and skin on the plate (Please look at the photo I took. Gone in 10 minutes. It was worth it!). Meat is very tasty and not too salty (which I prefer) without the need for lechon sarsa (liver gravy). In Cebu, they prefer to dip the lechon meat in spicy vinegar. Apart from lechon, they also serve Cebuano dishes. I recommend that you pair your lechon with an order of their Seaweed Platter, Sizzling Squid Stuffed with Sisig, Five Pork Fried Rice and, for your drink, try their Kamias Shake!

Yes, there are many different lechon places in Cebu and everyone will have their favorites. For me, it's not only about the lechon. I also love Zubuchon because the restaurant is very clean and the service is fast plus you don't need to line up to get your plate of lechon. For first time travelers to Cebu, I would definitely recommend that you eat here! :)","","",""

This restaurant is at the Ayala Terraces, across from the Ayala Mall. 

The service here is very very very slow.  I had to constantly get up to get a waiter because They weren't even paying attention to me waiving at them.  I've been to other Kuya J's restaurants and was never dissatisfied.  I was so disappointed that I wanted to walk out immediately when I got my food.  I was even being patient when it took forever to order my food and get drinks.  I was there for 2 hours and I only ordered Pinakbet, steamed bangus and the seafood platter.  Which by the way never get the seafood platter.  It's a waste of money.  They use small shrimp that they even cut up in pieces. It was like four tablespoons of mixed chopped up seafood in a platter.  I now wish I had taken a picture. I paid $900 for crappy food and crappy service.

The restaurant was half full.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

Food:  Everyone swore that the Brian's Ribs were the thing to get here.  It was even marked on the menu as a top seller.  So I decided to give it a try, along with calamari.  I was disappointed in both items.  The ribs were fall off the bone which was great; however, they were full of fat.  Sooooo much fat that I'm almost positive that it was more fat than meat on my plate. The calamari was super rubbery and tough to eat.  I definitely didn't choose correctly when ordering both of these items.  I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri, which was decent but not the best I've ever had.  Decent for the price.

Service:  Typical service that I experienced in the Philippines.  You have to call a waiter over because they won't come automatically.  Additionally, all of my food came at once even tho i ordered an appetizer first then an entree.

I wasn't impressed and wouldn't return unless it was a super happy hour special.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

Contrary to my girth, I am not that heavy of an eater, so finding a lechon joint that had single servings of lechon was a literal godsend. 

It also helped that this branch was at Cebu IT Park, a gorgeous city center if I ever saw one. Cebu IT Center reminds me of a circa-2000s BGC or Filinvest City with prettier buildings.

As for the lechon, yes it was yummy, although it felt a bit too oily for my liking. That kamias shake was the bomb, though.","","",""

Due to dietary restrictions I cannot consume raw food & seafood. That left me with the choice of the beef soba, and a side order of the tofu, topped with what they claim as ""land caviar"" (it is vegetarian). The food is very flavorful yet light. Truly highlights the freshness and quality of ingredients used. 

I also like that you didn't have to touch anything in the restroom - much of it has motion detection, including the toilet bowl.

My friend had the garden pizza and it reminded me of Mamas pizza on the street as a kid which was a score cus I love mamas pizza.

Definitely coming back to try the rest of the began dishes especially their air fries which they air fry.  Totally curious about that.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Had to wait for awhile to find out cause they were super busy.  There was a section for placing Take Out orders, and a section for Dine in orders.  Both were swamped with people.  Line went fairly quick.   Ordered my Cheeseburger plus fries and drink for 119 Philippine Pesos (a little over $2 USD).   

Cheeseburger tasted just the way I like it in the States.  Fries also had the same yummy taste.  There are a bunch of other goodies on their menu that are not found in the U.S.  I might be back to try some of them before we leave Cebu.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

The place itself is a cozy little cafe that caters to big and small groups alike, without sacrificing its laid-back and relaxed vibe. It's very well lit and the music isn't too loud, making it conducive for work or study. 

For food I highly recommend the chorizo and eggs in a pan, or any of their silogs. Their silogs are a bit pricier than your typical ones, but trust me, it's definitely worth it. For the full experience, pair your breakfast with coffee. I usually get the pour-over coffee, but their other coffees are also amazing.

If you're in Cebu for just a few days, and you wanted to have a great breakfast out, I highly recommend you check out Yolk!","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

It looks like a fast food joint, with few tables and hard booths--and an outpost downstairs where you can eat on stools outside, facing the parking lot of the Time Square complex. On the menu: lechon, lechon, lechon. And bottomless servings of rice.

Like a fast food place, it's served quickly from behind a counter, and with disposable packaging: straw ""plates"" on which to place your round wax paper cut-out and, oddly, plastic gloves. Lechon, which is traditionally eaten with bare hands, left workers' fingers greasy after lunch breaks so, following complaints, the restaurant decided to issue thin gloves to its customers. Many of the locals in the restaurant (not on their lunch break, and with their families) decided to forego the gloves. We, seriously considering a karaoke night afterwards, decided to use them.

The issue with the gloves is that, once you've helped yourself to rice (steamed and served in woven banana leaf pods) and that scrumptiously greasy lechon (I wasn't a fan of the skin and thick layer of fat that came with each piece, but even if you avoid those it gets oily), your gloves lose all manner of grip and you have trouble opening your subsequent rice pods.

Logistics aside, the lechon was an experience and the restaurant fine, but I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back. Instead, I'd spend more time at AA BBQ: goo.gl/bgeKOo","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

When I lived in Cebu, my friends and I  met once a week here for drinks, sunset, and dinner. We always sit outside on the plush lounge couches for a great view of the hills. It's pretty hot here, still though, so be prepared for that- and for the mosquitoes that don't really lessen up until about an hour after sunset (I do wish the restaurant could do something a little more about that). 

Usually, we would sit outside in the Anzani area and grab a menu from Bellini's as well because their menu is a little bit cheaper (You can order from either restaurant). Make sure to ask for the bread pots because they usually don't give to you unless you ask- they're actually super delicious. 

It's of course, very pricey, but very delicious and obviously, one of my favorite views in Cebu!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

I did notice that they had a spot at island central mall on mactan and would now be . opening. 
Build it and I will try it, sure enough the SM seaside location is open and I'm here on the first day.
Of course I had to try the Osaka takoyaki and their tonkatsu. I even ordered dessert.
First impressions, the broth and ramen of the tonkatsu was flavorful and nice texture of the ramen. The takoyaki was delicious on par with sachi which I also consider to have good takoyaki.
The anti climax was the dessert, I ordered the green tea ice shave. Presentation was not so great, I could not taste the green tea as it was overpowered by sugar and condensed milk.
However overall a great experience, I would come back again to try other dishes such as the yakisoba.","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

At quick glance, roasted pig, BBQ, sushi, cook to order sinigang (filipino sour soup), sashimi etc. We decided to have a go at it as we were celebrating a birthday in our group. 

The buffet had a juice station that had 3 varieties (orange juice, dalandan, and I forgot the 3rd kind) to choose from. I opted to try dalandan as I never had dalandan juice before. I took a few sips and strangely an odd after taste became apparent. I had my wife taste it as she said she's had dalandam juice before and she immediately said, ""don't drink that anymore. Either the cup is dirty or the water they use has an odor."" eeeek!! So I ended sticking to water (which didn't have any noticable odors or strange tastes, so maybe it was the cup?!). *gasps*

Now for the food. Cold, cold, and cold. I browsed around and cherry picked what they offered and sadly everything was cold. My dad ordered a shwarma with fries and it was cold, almost frozen. The sushi wasn't fresh. The rice was almost crispy like. Tuna sashimi didn't taste that great, seemed like it came from laying on ice then transferred on a serving plate but then left to fend for itself. What was meant to be hot was cold and what was meant to be cold was luke warm. The receptionist indicated that they opened at 6 PM for dinner, but all the food seemed as if its been left out for quite sometime. I expected the food thats intended to be hot would be piping hot as they did just open. Unfortunately not. Now I will say I was a big fan of their sinigang. Just the right tartness and super hot. We ordered a plate of bam-i which is like two types of noodles stir fryed. It was super salty. Their roasted pig tasted alright but you can tell its been sitting there for awhile as its gotten super dry, almost like a leather look. The BBQ was cold which was a huge turn off. The food was either dry, cold, warm or not fresh at all. I bypassed the salad bar as I noticed a fly just cruising through their leafy offerings. They had what appeared to be pastrami but when I tasted it, it was super spongy and dripped wet. *yuck*

For dessert, they had a variety of offerings but mostly local fare. I tasted the bread pudding and it was super dry, no sauce for it. Ice cream was pretty good and toppings can be found towards the salad bar. They offered conchenta (a brown jelly like dessert topped with coconut shavings), a casava dessert with caramalized coconut strands, chocolate fountain (but the liquid didn't look like chocolate, had a pink color), and small cake cuts normally found in average chinese buffets in the States. They also had a crepe station.

Staff: When we first were seated I got the feeling as if the person putting water in our glass was not ready to be bothered with. He didn't say anything and seemes to just want to get his duties over with. The rest of the evening waiters were attentive and kept making sure the cups were filled with water. Totally different attitude from the original guy who first filled our cups. I did mention to a lady, whom appeared to be a manager, that the dalandan juice tasted funny and that I will only be having water for my drink. She just stared at me and didn't say anything. *shrugs* It also appeared that they may lack in food prep staff as there were scarcely any attendants at the ""cook to order"" stations. 

As mentioned in the title, the restaurant itself was beautiful and nicely layed out (floor seemed to be newly mopped but no caution signs, so tread carefully). We didn't come here to observe the decorations. We came here to eat. Unfortunately, I was disappointed at the quality of the food that was offered.  I'm not sure if they had free wifi, I didn't have time to check. Birthday celebrants are free (with i.d. and given a slice of cake, thank you) and each adult was 850 pesos. We were told senior citizens also get a discount (with i.d.). Free parking.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

I think it's been one of Cebu's little dining secrets for the longest time. But, now, I'm seeing more branches opening in Manila.

This branch was one of the original restaurants. It didn't seem like much from the outside. Once you enter, the place is very clean and has modern interiors. You have 2 choices where to dine: the air-conditioned area and the al fresco area. We stayed in the air-conditioned area because it was hot that day.

Kuya J serves Filipino dishes such kare kare, crispy pata, and pochero. If I were you, skip all the meat and go straight for the Grilled Scallops! This is the best-seller and most popular appetizer. It's a simple dish actually. Scallops are topped with cheese and BUTTER then grilled. Served hot and fast, it only costs Php210 (4.51USD) per plate. We ended up ordering 3 plates. LOL! Other dishes you should try: Chorizo Dinamitas (chilis stuffed with chorizo meat), Lumpia Presko, and, for dessert, Tablea Flan with Coffee Syrup (chocolate flan with coffee caramel). Also, try their Dalandan Beer :)

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed our meal (even though it was mostly the Scallops!). If you're in Cebu, you should eat here! :)","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

This is a French theme joint. Pay a 10 peso entrance fee. 

Great wine selection, very fruity wine. If you don't like alcohol they serve some house wine that practically taste like strawberry soda. Some good food, with plenty of ice cream.

You can also walk up a bit higher and see the top of cebu. Relax and have another drink at different bars. Overall a good experience  to be with friends or chat up a date.","","",""

I was a bit worried that the place would be packed, but thankfully, that wasn't the case - it may be either because the place was very new at the time, it was a week day, and the fact that it's quite far from the city. Or a combination of some of those things lol.

We ordered halo-halo, baked scallops, sukwate, calamares, soup (can't remember which one), and turon.

I only got to try the baked scallops and calamares. I like how cheesy the baked scallops were, but I wasn't satisfied with their calamares - it wasn't really that crunchy which was a bit of a let down for me.

The place was great. Initially, we sat outside but there seemed to be a lot of flies there so we transferred inside - anyway, from our table we could see the same view. Service was alright too. Prices are a bit on the high side.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

But! I'll give them credit for my breakfast (although very small portioned) and for the fact that they have wifi to work with without asking for a password. The CR was clean too.

They have great selection of whisky' and wines, the menu is a digital tablet with almost 15/20 sections. They have options of 2-4 course menu meals or a la carte. A la carte is recommended. Their soups are excellent and so is Australian beef carpaccio. The pastas for main course with fresh cheese will keep your Italian loving  guests happy.  The Service matches the price and ambiance.  This restaurant was started by chef anzani and his chef wife. They also own gusto restaurant  in IT park in Cebu and chefs were at Shangri-La before starting anzani.

Salmon sinagong - this dish was tasty, but too salty for my palate. Salmon Sinagong 3 Stars because of too much salt
Pansit Guisado was absolutely delicious 5 Stars
Scallops w/melted cheese.  The picture looked good, but they sucked.  There was one tiny little scallop covered w/melted cheese.  Way too salty I would recommend against getting this item.  1 Star - Pricy and not very good.  
Calamansi juice was absolutely delicious with a nice citrus after bite.  Yummm I want some more now.  5 Stars

The dining area is very nice, good service.  It was funny watching people after eating sitting back and just enjoying the moment of a great meal","","",""

Almost all of their customers are local,  and hardly any tourist come here because they have no idea it exist. The meaning of  ""Pungko"" in Cebuano is to squat or crouch. ""Punko"" are business stalls around streets of Cebu that basically sells random deep fried food.  Food like Lumpia,  chicken wings, roasted pig, deep fried pig intestines and ears and so on. They are accompanied with vinegar dipping sauce with chilli, garlic and onions,  to cut the fat and to enhance flavor. I prefer a lot of chili on mine and it was delicious. There are no utensils. You will eat with your hands, but you are given a plastic bag to cover your hands so you never get your hands greasy or dirty. 

My Aunt's nephew,  who was our tour guide and tours visitors for a living took us here, after he learned I am a foodie, and much prefer to dine locally, and eat where all the locals go. 

If you are ever in Cebu City,  this is one area in Fuente I highly recommend you pay a visit. It gets pack for lunch as almost all the locals here comes  to eat. Note that you may be sharing your tables with strangers,  but I think it's the best way to get to know the people of Cebu.

Cheers!","","",""

This (10 Dove Street Confectionery) on the other hand is kinda new. Also located within Oakridge Business Park, they offer mostly cakes, cupcakes, coffee, sandwiches like panini, and other desserts. What I like about the place is the ambiance. Looks cozy to hangout and grab a slice of cake to eat. The lighting is pretty good as well. The employees are really attentive, accomidating, and hospitable as well. One of my favorite is their chocolate decadence cake. It's really rich, creamy, and moist. Ube cake is also one of my favorites as well as the mixed versions including ube-mango. And let's not forget their seasonal avocado. Aside from cakes, they also have cupcakes, mini cheesecakes, paninis, and coffee based drinks. I ordered out the chicken panini to eat later. For me, their cakes is one of the best I've had here in Cebu. I haven't tasted everything but I would definitely come back again for more.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

The resto is conveniently located in EBloc2 and boasts of its tasty meals. They serve fast too. Been here a couple of times and I don't have to wait long before my order is served. The crew is very polite and accommodating too.

You can choose from a variety of dishes. I would always go back though for my all-time favorite, the Adobomb! It's their own recipe for the traditional Filipino adobo. Slow cooked and the flavor seeped in the meat. It is served with two eggs cooked the way you want it (except boiled). I hope it can be lenient enough to do boil egg soon.

Their chicken inasal is also a must-try.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

First of all, for those who do not know what Ngohiong is (like me at first who just ate it without knowing what it was. Thought it was some sort of fried seaweed or something) its actually a mix of singkamas (jicama) and ubod (heart of the coconut). Add up a mixture of 5 spices, garlic, pork, shrimp or both etc and that pretty much makes up for this well known Cebuano street food.

This particular food spot however is known by word of mouth from the locals so at this time it's still a hidden gem. Especially since it's not easily accessible and is really just the ""front yard"" of a private house at this point. Who knows in the future. Doming's really serve very good ngohiong. The crunch is perfect, the seasoning good and the sauce, which is essential, is on point. Ngohiong may not suit everybody's tastebuds though. Honestly, i wasnt a big fan at first but i guess there was something about the wrap and the sauce that just makes me want one every now and then. 

Still a must try for those who havent had it yet! 

(PS: cant say much for the rest of the food since i only get these when I eat here)","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

We got there around 1:00 in the afternoon and it wasn't too crowded luckily. It seemed like a free for all, just grab what you want and give it to them to cook for you. Somehow they magically know which plate belongs to which table and they'll bring it out to you once everything is all cooked. Luckily I was with Matias experts so they knew all the ropes! Don't expect anything fancy, it's literally just some good ol fashioned home style bbq with classic vinegar and soy sauce. Everything was delicious but the chicken was probably my favorite. So tender! Don't forget the puso, or hanging rice either! Add on a mango shake, you won't regret it. We had almost a dozen different mango shakes during our stay in the Philippines and this one was easily in my top 3 favorites.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

One of the waiters (trainee) at the podium seated me & my husband and pretty much rushed us to order the lechon. He kept saying there was only half of the lechon left and everything else is spicy. To reserve the regular lechon we would need to place an order right at that second so he can hold it for us. I asked if we could do half portion of each. He says yes. My husband points to the menu and clearly said we would like 1/8 kg of each since we're only 2 people and planned to order a couple of other dishes. He just said ""yes, half and half"". He then says our assigned waiter will come by to take the rest of our order.

A few minutes later, we realized that the waiter may not have fully understood us. My husband went looking for him. The waiter said the orders for 1/2 kg of each are already in and the meat is chopped. There's no going back. Dude, did you really expect a party of 2 to finish 2.2 lbs of meat? The waiter came back momentarily and repeated that he could not cancel the second order of lechon. 

We sat there pretty upset, but readied ourselves for all that meat. In the 10-15 minutes of waiting for the ""already chopped meat"", the assigned waiter never came by to take the rest of our order nor ask us if we'd like drinks. You could clearly see him looking glum walking aimlessly around the room.

The lechon finally came out and management approved cancelling 1 of the orders for us. Thank you, ma'am. The meat was tender & delicious. Gravy was super salty, though. I recommend eating it with the vinegar on the table & some gravy and a bowl of rice. If only we didn't have so much meat, we would have ordered a vegetable dish, a seafood dish, and dessert.

Oh well! Time to try another lechon place.","","",""

I suggest to travel here with a huge group.  It's a lot more fun.  The way you order is you choose a vendor where you will buy your seafood and meat.  They will hire the guys to grill them. Certain tables are owned by certain vendors and they will direct you to a table that is theirs. My favorite has to be their grilled stuff squid.  It was so good and you can really tasted the charcoal grill.  

They get very busy after 6pm to midnight everyday, so make sure to arrive early to get the best fresh seafood daily.

Cheers!","","",""

I like the original coffee prince more but this is still a great place to hang out though a little too crowded if you just want to sit down for a cup of coffee. I don't suggest that you go there alone.

The food, I am NOT a big fan of, which I am quite surprised because I like Korean food. I'm also a big fan of desserts but theirs did not really hit the spot for me. However, I will give 7 out of 10 for their drinks especially with their cotton candy addition. If they downplayed the sweetness of their offerings I would rate them higher.

Service is probably the highlight of this little cafe. They have great, happy people working for them & that makes a big difference.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

It's a perfect stop if you're in the mood for a healthy, cold drink.

The cafe itself is very clean and super adorable with peach and gray decor. You'll be met with a healthy vibe to go with the healthy veggie and fruit smell, right as you walk in. There is plenty of seating so meeting friends here is definitely an option.

They have reading materials to use while you're there and some plants and healthy foods for sale. They offer energy bowls, smoothies, teas, Adlai bowls, toasts, cold pressed juices, and other refreshments. Try the Big Green Smoothie. It's delish! 

We like this little juice spot. Hope you do, too!

See ya there!","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

It's a small tradition we started and always makes me homesick.  The menu is creative with great combinations and classic flavors. Their orange hot sauce is incredible! It's hot, bold and takes the hamburger to another level. I highly recommend the Jalapeño burger.  Find their original location just off Escario or their new location at Oakridge on A.S. Fortuna.

That's why my coworkers and I, none of whom are vegan, were so excite when we found this place. We LOVE it! We order gems like cauliflower casserole, Mexican Nachos (which aren't Mexican but are still very good, the Vegan stew, and more. You can see the pics I've posted to get an idea of their offerings.

So, please go here if you're anywhere near Park Mall. Or go here even if you have to jump in a taxi. Definitely go here if you are Vegan, vegetarian, or just like veggies. Their food is great. And we want them to stay in business so we can eat there on each trip to Cebu. LoL

Service is very good. Place its self is excellent. Giving a 4-star is due to the following based soley on my opinion.

Tacos - the carne asade while tender, should be sliced a bit more into smaller pieces. Taste wise it's not close to the mexican tacos I have had. So sorry but even the tacos from a food truck taste way better. 

Fajita Ajo - very very good chicken. It was tasty and tender. No complains there.

Fajita Carnitas - good but not spectacular. Baked beans was a let down. 

But overall food is good. Hence, the 4-stars. But for a mexican restaurant locally here in Cebu it is the best.

It's buffet style, with fresh seafood you choose on the spot and they cook to order. From fish to scallops to shrimp to oysters, and different ways to prepare and season, everything tasted delicious. They also have lobster and king crab for an additional price. Drinks are not included but can be added for a small price. 

The service was also superb with different people checking in on us throughout the meal, asking for additional drinks and warning us when it was last call for the kitchen. 

For those who are considering going soon, they have a discounted rate until April 26, 2019 for the buffet. If you're in the area or coming to visit, I'd definitely recommend you check it out!","","",""

Buffets are not my thing so bear with me. 

The ambiance is has a very high end feeling and staff was attentive so yay for that.

First off let me say the draft beer and sangria on a self serve tap is genius and would probably be illegal in Canada. However the sangria was not the greatest, could be sweeter and colder. The beer is SM so basically piss. If it was flavoured (Apple) I'd be happier

Standard mix of Japanese, Chinese, and western. Lamb roast was dry my exes personality. Pizza was soggy. However the fish is great as they are made to order. 

The noodle bar is limited however worth a try. Avoid sashimi as it may cause stomach problems being of a lower grade cut

We walk in hoping for something outstanding, but sadly, it's just the same moderately-flavoured stuff: ordered the grilled boneless bangus (milk fish), lato beaded seaweed 'salad,' grilled pecho (breast/winged) chicken, and a green buko (coconut) juice drink with the usual wee bit of soft flesh. All was okay, but no being able to apply spices and herbs beyond the predictable raw onions, scattered raw semi-hot little peppers, soy sauce and whitish vinegar means that the relative tastelessness of it all lands flat as if into the swamp from where some of it sprang.

Too bad, but Neo Neo by Jing Jing at the J. Centre Mall - this specific venue - is in a bad location, and as per the food, wouldn't cut it at any chicken or seafood operation in the developed world. If you want better grilled chicken, try the tastier Jo's Inato in the Visayas (but not Manga Inasato).

Sorry readers, but if you dislike mediocrity, skip Neo Neo!","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

As a Filipino teen, my mom hung out at Max's. It's her first stop whenever she gets off the plane because she's absolutely obsessed with their halo halo.

And I have to admit, Max's is the BEST halo halo I've ever had. From the perfectly crushed ice to the cubed jelly, ube jalaya, flan, red beans, white beans, pinipig and the humongous scoop of ube ice cream on top eating a bowl is truly a treat yourself moment. While you may be tempted to share a bowl with friends, I highly recommend getting one for yourself. Besides, you are paying in pesos so it's literally pennies!

While I'm team Chicken Joy for life, Max's makes a pretty mean rendition too (it's what they are famous for). Super crispy and not super big and hormone loaded like American chickens. 

Service here, like everywhere in the Philippines is super slow.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

I ate alone. My family stayed up in our rooms, tired from a day of touring. I was rushed to order, first in tagalog (of which i don't understand much as an American), then in English. 
I ordered a pot of green tea, and they brought me a cup of jasmine tea. I was confused, but i accepted as I'm not one to be too picky.
When I asked for a recommendation the waiter nonchalantly pointed at some pork dish, which happened to be the cheapest thing on the page. I didn't go for it. Instead, I ordered fried noodles, barbeque pork, and rice. I had no intention of finishing it all. I wanted to bring some food back to my family. 
The staff stood around me staring at me and whispering to each other as I ate. Three different servers came to my table and all spoke to me in tagalog, forcing me to inform them that I only spoke English multiple times. 
The absolute worst part was when I tried to bill the food to my room, they informed me that ""the system was broken"" and I would have to pay cash/card. This seemed like an obvious ploy to make sure that I wasn't scamming the restaurant. I left the place insulted, uncomfortable, and actually full on a decent meal. The service was abhorrent and not representative of any respectable hotel.

 My friend and I came around 7pm, we waited in front and got to see all the meats they had and placed our order. 
all the good stuff like the chicken heart, tuna belly and liver were sold out for the day, so we ended up getting the chicken thigh, chicken breast, chorizo, pork skewer, and ribs I believe. 

As we waited for them to grill our food, we picked a table and the waitress came over and took our order for rice and beverages.  About 10-15 minutes later we have our rice and bbq meats!

The meats were tender and fell off the bone, they were perfectly cooked! The bbq sauces were delicious , it had a nice sweet Smokey taste. 

We literally spent about $15 for everything.

This place is a must try if you're around.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Fortunately we also had butter and jam from the other dish which was used for the pancakes, as the bread was really dry and did not improve with an application of butter and jam. The omelet started off great especially when looking for a meat-free meal, light, tasty, with a bit of ooey gooey cheese, but when I cut into the omelet the eggs were uncooked and not in the good way, It's a great early morning breakfast spot, but be prepared for a pricey less than perfect meal.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

As a self proclaimed Cebuana, it was my duty to show them around. The tourist spots were easy and I know each and everyone of them like the back of my hand but when they asked me what's a nice local place to try in Ayala, I was stumped. I had to ask a friend of mine who lives there and she pointed us to the direction of Golden Cowrie. 

After a seemingly eventful morning at Kartzone we decided to head over to Golden Cowrie per my friend's suggestion. The place was full but luckily a group was on their way out when we came in so we were immediately seated. We loved the food, it's really good! Even though you can find it here in Manila, there's still something special about having it there.

If you're ever in Ayala, go visit Golden Cowrie!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Decor - Just like the hotel, the restaurant is downright artsy and eclectic, but yet not overwhelming.  There is a perfect balance of whimsy and structure.  

Ambience - Ate very late dinner (think 11:30 pm), and two days of breakfast buffets that came with my reservations.  Place was only 15% filled, so not crowded at all.  I actually enjoyed the somewhat empty and silent feel.

Menu - They have a good mix of appetizers, soup, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, main course, and dessert.  I personally felt the pricing was adequate, with most items in the 300+ peso range, with the exception of some main courses.  

Food - Tried the adobo flakes, calamari, and surprise, surprise - the seafood pasta...  (hint - Almost everywhere I've traveled to, seafood pasta is my go-to).  ALL WERE DELICIOUS!!!  For the breakfast, the selection consisted of typical Filipino full breakfast items, which honestly, I wanted and craved for:  Fried garlic rice, corned beef, eggs, somekind of pasta, sausage  (my kids ate and didn't like it), and my favorite - fried bangus.  They had the typical breads and a waffle maker, fruit, and so on.  Still enjoyed it. 

Service - They are friendly, and they checked to see how we were doing - something not normal in most restaurants in the PI. 

If I wasn't pressed for time, I wouldn't have mind eating here over and over again, but I was.  However, I would love to come back to The Henry and definitely eat at Rica's again!  It's probably one of the most enjoyable places I've ever been to!","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

There are many vendors in the area to choose from (it can seem overwhelming because each vendor wants you to buy from their stand). Each stand has its own seating area and once you choose your meats the cooks will immediately grill them and deliver them to your table. It is a kamayan style of eating (no utensils) and they provide plastic gloves. It's great for large groups and an overall fun experience!","","",""

Unfortunately, it was some of the worst and uncomfortable service to begin the experience, but we stuck it out. Before the bad is upon the restaurant, I will review the service then finish on a good note, the food. 
The server (F) had ignored our repeated polite flagging, and we had to have another (M, Mark), complete our order. This girl was obviously having a bad day (or time) and ensured that either everyone knew or suffered along with her. It's a pity some people think that way. Enough. 
As for the food, beef caldereta was tasty and generous with chunks of meat. The tortang talong was firm but slightly greasy. It was accompanied by a sweet syrupy sauce that had mixed reviews. And the pinakbit was firm, flavorful and heaping. For me it's what I come to this establishment to eat. 
So as ratings go, food 4, and service 1 averages to 3. 
I hope that SM City Kuya J's, will consider this review and appreciate it for its value.","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

Be sure to get there early for lunch or dinner as they often run out of some menu items (most likely chicken). You go to the grill station and pick what you want and give it to the chef. Then have a seat at a table where your waiter will give you a plate of puso (hanging rice) and take your drink order (water, beer, soda, or shakes). Eat it with your hands while it is hot because that's when it is most delicious!
If you are germaphobe then this place is not for you. But if you don't mind eating with your hands and stray animals running about, then you are in for a treat! It is inexpensive too! I love this place!
There are plenty of pictures on google. I wish I had some but my finger are just to busy eating to take pictures.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

No lines yet there were plenty of people inside already. I guess reservation is highly recommended since they get full pretty fast. 

On entry you can already see an array of food. You are greeted first by their display of desserts. Makes you want to rush eating to get to them lol as you move to the right side you can find a great number of delicious food from tapas, spicy paella, assortment of seafood, roasted pork, steaks and a filipino food station. Their is also sushi, chinese station, italian station, and during lunch time they also offer a good number of breads. 

I was amazed by the number of drinks they have mostly healthy too. From watermelon to lemon infused iced tea, guava, papaya and even cucumber which i found really refreshing. There is also sago and gulaman which is not so healthy but definitely pleasing to the taste buds lol and last but not the least my favorite part when eating...dessert! Ooh how i loved their taro panna cotta and their ube pao (i made that dessert lol). Today they had unicorn cupcakes but i was too full i didnt get to try it. It looked moist and yummy.

There is such a huuuge selection of food and i have not seen anything in comparison to this in the US. That being said i believe this would probably be one of the things i'll miss now when we leave. Definitely a 5 star and a must try place!","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

I went with the chicken and chorizo paella, lengua, and churros for dessert. The flavors are there for the paella, the lengua gravy tasted commonplace borderline like jollibee gravy. the churros were good though slightly undercooked imho, but at least did not taste greasy or soaked in oil. the chocolate dip was really good and i would order everything again but maybe try the different paellas.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

The service is friendly, food is delicious, and the atmosphere is laid back.  They have live music some nights and will sometimes surprise you with an amazing American-style apple pie.  My favorites include their salmon dish and their Caesar salad. They have other American and European options.

We recommend it to those looking for great food and a break from traditional Filipino food.

I had never had tuna jaw before and was surprised by how humongous one portion of a fish mouth could be. It was like the biggest steak I've ever eaten times three! They grill the jaws right outside the restaurant so you are already salivating by the time you walk in. I'm used to eating my tuna raw so I found the jaw to be drier than I would have liked it. It had a very meaty quality and was devoured by the table.

To me the real stars of the show were the side dishes we got (which by the way we ended up with tons of leftovers since the tuna jaw was so big). The bulalo was like nilaga, a traditional Filipino beef stew only the flavor was amped up by a thousand thanks to the addition of bone marrow and brightyl colored vegetables. It was even a bit spicy which gave the whole dish a nice kick. Move over sinigang, I think I have a new favorite Filipino soup!

I also really loved the crispy kang kong which was lightly battered and fried and served with a creamy and cooling dipping sauce. I can definitely see why my family loves this place so much!","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Paella Negra is all about its squid component, hence the black color while the lechon version, as the name suggests, highlights the Cebuano favorite as it's center. The valenciana, on the other hand, has mixed seafood in it.

So far, I have tried paella negra and valenciana and both are so damn good. Although I forgot to note the price of each, valenciana is the most expensive of the three varieties, at P148 for the solo meal (no drinks).

If you're with a group, they also have a choice of going for a bigger serving than a solo as you could go for the bigger platter that is good for 2-3 persons or the biggest, which is good for 4-5 persons.

As there is not much on the menu other than these paella dishes and some sides, it's very nice of them to allow food to be brought in from outside at no extra charge and no fuss.

I was with a friend who didn't feel like having paella at that time so he ended up buying a takeout from a nearby restaurant and eating it with me at the Hala Paella.

So far, my experience with their dishes has
been amazing and I'll definitely go back again and again. 

On a side note, they used to have a stall at the Sugbo Mercado in IT Park but I haven't seen them there this week.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

The ladies working there were also very sweet! They gave us matching cups to compliment our meal. I would definitely come back in a heart beat when in Cebu!

Horrible food!!! And expensive for what you are getting.","","",""

Who is also known for baking excellent wedding cakes!

I was thrilled to know she is opening a cafe as it would mean easy access to her cakes lol i love the texture of the pastries she makes and one of my favorites is their classic chocolate cake. It is not too sweet, icing is made smooth and delicate and texture is just right. The green tea and sesame cake had a chiffon-cake texture but surprisingly it blended pretty well with the icing/mousse that it was such a joy to eat.

I can't say much for the coffee as i havent tried it but i bet they are pretty good as well. I expected nothing but the best from Trina. Treat Street is definitely worth trying!","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

If you like barbecue. Then come here please. You pick the meat or fish you want them to bbq for you. And then they bring it to you and eat. You can also have the fish either grilled or turned into soup. It is an experience i haven't had before and i am glad that my friend brought us here. At first the place looked skeptical because it definitely looked like a wet market. But from my experience, skeptical usually means great food. 
Place can be crowded and loud because of people barking at passerby's in an attempt to get them to eat at their stalls. There are also alot of flies because it is outdoors and the place is a bit dirty lookin. 
The great side about this place is that the food is cooked deliciously!!! It was amazing.. i kept eating and eating. I was definitely surprised on how good the food came out. 
If you are a picky eater or someone that may want to make sure what you are eating is 100% taken care of an sanitary. You might lose your mind in this place cuz i personally doubt that this place is clean, but it is probably safe to eat to some extent. Place gets crowded late at night. 
I'd come back here. I'd even bring my family","","",""

But what if you decided, to really appreciate the ramen and went for something where more time was spent in making the noodle and broth that went into it?

This brings us to the the ramen shops where people come in to appreciate such work. You step into this place and you get the impression, they know what they are doing and it seems they do, since I notice people that look like regular customers. In addition, the place has been in the area for a while. 

You can't really go wrong with any of the choices, but I went with the ramen tonkatsu since it comes with some slices of pork along with a side order gyoza. Be sure to look a the menu, since it gives a description on what each ramen bowl offers in flavor and the staff is more than kind to assist in helping you choose the right meal for you. To me its about the noodle texture and the broth. As you slurp in the noodle and take in some broth, you can't help but feel a sense of comfort.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Owned by the prestiged abaca group, this is one of the variety of restaurants they have. When you come in, you are warmly greeted and welcomed by the friendly employees. The place seems to be packed most of the time especially on a busy weekday lunch hour. No need for fancy booklet menus, their menu is on the board. Every now and then they introduce something new and/or a special item for the day. You can opt to ask if you want coriander on your pho or not but for me, I like it ""everything on it"". Condiments are placed on top of your bowl of pho, but you can ask them to separate it on the side, while the sauces, pickled garlic, and lime are served on the side. The place seems to be pretty clean and the service was great and fast. Airconditioning and ventilation was good as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking and craving for some pho/vietnamese food.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

I actually visited their original one, Cafe Laguna. Same menu from what the wait-staff has told me.

Got to try their Merienda section's Puto Bungbong; with a cool Four Season Shake on the side. I actually have asked if I may get the shake's white sugar on the side and mix it on my own. But when it came in, it was still the syrup mix; at least it was on the side... never to be touched.

The Puto Bungbong was so-so. I've tasted better. It came wrapped in foil. From that, it seems they have baked it(?) Somewhat of a drier texture that I'm used to. Took out a star because of that.

The service is good though. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Will go back again to try their other offerings and hopefully get my rating up for them.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Located in a business park on the upper level, the place seemed to be attracting all those nearby because of the lead singer, belting out on the microphone.  Once we arrived up there, we got one of the last group tables of the place, watching the live band jam out.  

I only drank beer here, while my relatives ordered some bar food (chili cheese fries and sisig).  It's a bar and there's bar food here.  If you're looking for actual good food then Timeout isn't your place.  It's known for the fun, lively environment that it has, with a live band playing metal rock, where the entire audience sings along while the lead singer whips her hair back and forth and often sings, standing on the bar!  It's a fun place!  Come for the experience!  
 
Despite how busy the place got, service was always on point.  They even offered free shots of vodka for the entire place, going around to all the tables, pouring a shot for all those willing to party.  Timeout is where to do it on a Saturday night.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

We had the classic Zubuchon Lechon, along with the scallop appetizers, and garlic rice.

The lechon meat was very good. Juicy, chunky pieces. But the best part was the crispy, deep fried skin. So full of flavor, and not chewy at all. 
The scallops were a let down, especially after having them at Kuya J's. 
I would go back, if I were to ever return to Cebu, which is probably never.","","",""

I went for my lunch break today as I was doing the day shift at work in IT Park. I am not a fan of their hours but that's because I'm usually on the local night shift. They close at what is expected for restaurants in the US. However, given their location, I think they are missing the majority of their business as there are so many night shifters.

Their menu looks good given you eat meat. I was a little surprised by eating at a Thai place as I'm from the US. In the IS, all Thai restaurants let you pick a protein with a km most every dish and also a spice level. Nope. You get what's on the menu. I bet you could substitue, but I didn't ask.

The food was not really what I expected for thai. I had the mixed vegetables. The sauce was quite delcious....but when I eat Thai I expect some kind of heat. White rice was an add on  for 40 pesos....and that is quite an expensive for white rice in the PH. I can find it for 10 pesos or less almost anywhere else.

It was clean, the air con was cold, and quite comfortable seats.  If you're working in IT Park frequently, it's a good stop. If you're visiting Cebu as a tourist, I recommend the Blue Elephant in the Red Apple building in Cebu Business Park. It's on the top floor, has same food and prices, but comes with an excellent view.","","",""

We were a group of 9 people so we needed a place that is not so expensive but good and STK ta Bai delivered.

The fish cheeks were awesome that we decided to get two. My sister , T and I basically went to all the nook and cranny of cheeks to find the last bit of meat in it.

We also selected some fresh crab and fish and ask them to cook it for us. 

Food arrived in a decent amount of time, and really good.

Everyone enjoyed the food and we still got some remaining dishes that we took home with us.

I highly recommend this place if you are ever in Cebu City.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Each store has their own tables where you can eat. 
Con is that they dont have a bathroom or a place to wash your hands. You can ask for them to provide you with a pail of water to do so or they themselves provide you with gloves so you can eat.

At its best, 'Cebu's Original Lechon Belly' is second to none. But the drawback is that they're not always serving the highest quality that they're capable of. This is probably due to the fact that at differing times of the day, their servings will have differing freshness, and the longer the pork is off the grill, the less crispy the skin is and the less tasty it is.

The bread, cheese, and size of the slice are very familiar to those who have tried a Costco slice but the toppings were an interesting change of flavor. If you want you can still get your usual pepperoni, cheese, and combo, but since your in Cebu why not live a little and try something new. 

Just like the Costco pizza in the states, these slices will do the job to satisfy a pizza craving. Nothing to rave about but it will do.

What changed about their Pho?

They seem to have reduced the portion size while keeping prices the same.  It's broth, it doesn't cost a lot to produce.  

Undercooked slightly hard fettuccini noodles.  

The bean sprouts were already in the bowl and amount seemed much less also.  I wasn't sure if they were even there. 

Broth was not as good as I remember.  

This was my favorite restaurant in all the Philippines and now I don't even want to go back.  This is truly sad and it was something I looked forward to when visiting this city.  I will go to the Banilad location to see if it's the same.  If it is, I'll give my feedback again in person.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Some local friends recommended Cafe Laundrette for their sour Pork Sinigang Soup. Since I love tangy dishes, I checked it out for lunch today. It was DELICIOUS - the broth was amazing and pork was so tender! Wow, I seriously think I found my new favorite soup. 

We also ordered the pork stroganoff, which is not my thing but was also very good. Their winter melon milk tea w/ pearls was also delicious. 

It's two doors down from the Julia's Bakery.

I'll definitely be back... and probably order the soup every time.

Over the years, it has also changed dramatically from stalls having individual areas for grilling to one that has a centralised area for grilling, making it less likely for you to leave the area smelling like smoke. The wash area has also been slightly improved though I'd rather bring my wet wipes and alcohol. Be sure to choose the stall you want as though they generally offer the same selection, they have some slight nuances such as perhaps one would have shrimp and prawns, the other would have pork belly and another may not offer seafood at all.

Took my Manila family here who is not really familiar with what's popular to Cebuanos (my Cebu family loves this place). They ended up thoroughly enjoying the food. Only thing is, it may take some time for your food to come out, which is ok because it's all good anyway! Just make sure you have the time. Lastly, their ube Halo Halo is mmmazing! I love ube and I love how they have a large chunk of ube halaya at the bottom PLUS ube ice cream. The macapuno has the right consistency. The corn flakes are a nice touch. The snow-ice is the best!

As someone who's lived in cebu her entire life, not to mention has eaten lunch a good number of times, I must disagree; Zubuchon gives lechon a very bland flavor. I don't feel much but the texture once I munch on it. 
If anything, it is slightly average, or very much below the line. There are plenty of other lechon places in cebu where you can truly taste a REAL Cebuano lechon. Just being honest","","",""

I ordered a falafel sandwich and they charged me extra to get lettuce on my sandwich instead of cabbage... tahini was as thick as water.... 
also I ordered a beef shawarma sandwich and they charged me extra when I asked for extra onion... AND they charged me 10% extra as a service charge 
2nd time I was there I placed an order to go and this time also they charged me 10% extra for service charge... I told the cashier I am not dining in so why the extra 10% for service charge? I am taking the food out so you should not charge me 10% extra? She said the extra 10% service charge applies for all orders either dine in or take out... I canceled my order and left.... this was the only restaurant I ever visited in the Philippines that charges service charge... I think the owner is a very greedy person and have no business understanding to charge this extra charge in the first place and I think it's very stupid to charge the extra charge on to go orders... 
I will never visit this restaurant again and I don't recommend dealing with greedy owner as this owner.","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

Dim sum is usually not one of my first cuisine picks, though I couldn't pass up the chance to dine at this restaurant. Small menu, with photos of each menu item - nice touch. The pork buns. Oh, the pork buns. These are what earned this restaurant it's Michelin star. Traditionally steamed, but Tim Ho Wan got it right by baking them. Perfection! Take note, filling is on the sweeter side - if that doesn't suit your tastes. Congee was ok, not too salty considering the salted duck egg. The wasabi shrimp salad dumplings were delicious! I often find that deep fried dumplings at dim sum restaurants are often too greasy as if they've absorbed the oil or tasting like old/stale fryer oil. Not the case here. Gailan was steamed just right and still crunchy. Everything else was delicious. Food came out quick, and more or less all at the same time. Happy we came. Great meal overall. Only regret is overeating (as per usual) and not saving room to try dessert.","","",""

My wife and her friend each had a slice of Yema cake.  I had a slice of Mango Cloud cake.
My Mango Cloud was alright.  Tasted a bit dry, and the filling was just alright.  Probably would not order again.  The Yema cake was yummy!  

We got Silvanas for take out.  They were supposed to give it to us frozen like the package says, but it was not frozen.  Honestly, though, that did not bother me.  It still tasted awesome!!!

They have other food besides desserts.  Seriously, though, I think the desserts our the items to purchase at Sans Rival.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

not as good as the expensive restaurants but its not bad considering location and price. It was my first time trying yakisoba so I don't have anything to compare it to.
The tokoyaki is not bad, though they have squid instead of octopus. Not as good as sachi or osaka takoyaki but pretty good. If I am in the area I would definitely stop by fkr a meal.

This is where the Noel Family made their name in quality and service. Some say it's a TGIF, but to me it's vastly different. TGIF is an over-glorified restaurant that is ludicrous in their menu prices with what I consider to be subpar cuts of meat. Casa Verde excels where most other bbq joints in the greater Cebu area do not.

Each time I visit the ancestral homeland, I always stop by here and grab a plate. This review is long overdue, a good 3 yrs since I've eaten there. I was just looking at photos and became nostalgic so decided to see if Casa Verde would appear on Yelp.

Yes there are plenty of other places to get your BBQ fix in Cebu, but it's more ""Asian Style"" than western proper. Each have their nuances, for Casa Verde, it was that ""American"" portion of big, bold, and meaty. First time I came here was in 2008/9, I felt happy and intimidated by the copious amounts of meat I had shoved in my mouth. Fast forward to 2013, stopped by here again and waited it out in line. Monday night (photo date shows it to be a Monday) and for me it was not busy at all, rather surprised because in past experiences Casa Verde is always packed especially from Thur-Sat. Ms. Seattle ordered some type of salad (really?!) but I do recall that was quickly swapped as she proceeded to eat my steak and grilled shrimp. This was 3 yrs ago, but wading through past memories is always a good thing, especially when it pertains to good food.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

The place is a small private kitchen and is currently limited to only 6 persons (4 at the counter and 2 at the table). You need to make an advance reservation if you want to eat at this place since it's impossible to just walk-in and hope to find an available seat. You can either call or book online to place for a reservation. The ingredients are carefully sourced and picked fresh everyday. Their soba is made to order, it is made fresh in front of you. The ingredients for their soba is imported directly from Hokkaido, Japan and is flown directly from there and not through sea cargo(since shipping it by sea and risk exposing it to heat would ruin/change the distinct characteristics of the soba). There's also a decent choice of beverages including liquors like sake and some beers. I definitely would go back and would recommend this place to anyone.

We beat the dinner rush because only two other tables had patrons.  Our group of six was seated right away.  The colorful decor reminds me of Mexican restaurants at home.  Much of the menu is Mexican cuisine inspired.

A few folks in our party ordered Frozen Iced Tea.  It was different and tasty.  My niece ordered her other favorite two items as well.  A Pasta entree and Pumpkin soup.  She finished them both.  My nieces shared the Amigos Platter which included salsa, chips, fries, a quesedilla sort of thing, and onion rings.  It was okay.  Wifey said her Tuna Belly entree was pretty good.  My Mooonte Christo sandwich was okay too.  Was truly expecting more flavor, though.

It will probably be awhile before I return to Mooon Cafe again.  Cebu has so many good restaurants, and I still have to give others a try.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

We had dinner at 7:00 pm and pretty much left at 11 pm very dissatisfied with the experience.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Red house is a very close walk from where we stayed. It's down an awkward little side street, not particularly close to any other restaurants.

It's Shabu Shabu, so we got to do our own cooking while there. They set a large pot of basic soup in front of you, you start ordering anything you want and cook those items in the soup. 

We ordered mushrooms, thinly cut beef and pork, shrimp, and something that looked liked Bok Choy. All delicious. 

Be sure to cook the thinly sliced meat for no longer than 10 seconds, or the time it takes to loose it's red color. 

They also have a table in the middle of the restaurant where you can bring back toppings to your table. White and green onions, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

You can smell the Lechon essence even from 50 feet away while its still cooking.

For a very tasty treat of this delicious Lechon, it should be served fresh from the ""open air oven"" (Lechon is cooked in an open space where available. Most Filipinos cook Lechon at their open backyards). Knife please, cut open the stomach part and let the ""Lechon Spice Soup"" out! This mouthwatering part is the best. Get some of the crispy skin part near the neck or the back part, dip it in the Lechon Spice Soup - taste and savour this heavenly Filipino delicacy!

Overall, we can say that the BBQ is OK, the seafood is terrible, and the sides was a good try which we compare to great Korean restaurants in Ellicott City, Maryland and Honolulu, Hawaii. The service started fine and we received all the side dishes and meats as listed on the menu. Then after this initial delivery of food, the waiter serving our table decided that he was no longer going to serve us and service other bigger party tables instead. We ordered some BBQ and he never came back which after about 30+ minutes I decided enough is enough and had to talk to manager about the neglect of servicing our table.  This is by far the worst service my family and I ever experienced from any restaurant we've been to. Also, after the initial set of BBQ meats served, they began pushing the lesser quality meat and surely slowed the service as a tactic to slow down ordering anymore BBQ. For example, I would try and order the short ribs (Kalbi) but they kept bringing a beef tip that had this big bone instead which was definitely not short ribs. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The only thing that we actually enjoyed was the live band playing.

The restaurant may look old and tired but it is always crowded. Here, you can enjoy your fried chicken meal with other Filipino dishes like pansit, sizzling bangus or sinigang at affordable prices. For merienda, they offer sandwiches and combo meals. But, honestly, you go here for the Fried Chicken. That's all you need to remember. Fried. Chicken.

I always order the Classic chicken meal. It's 3 pieces of delicious, crispy-on-the-outside-juicy-on-the-inside fried chicken and comes complete with rice, thick french fries and coleslaw on the side. All that for only Php178 (3.81USD)! No need for gravy! All you need to do is mix ketchup and Worcestershire sauce with a little bit of hot sauce. Also, when you're here, you must order their legendary Crispy Chicken Skin! It's always the very thing that runs out though. So, I usually order the next best thing: Fried Chicken Necks! You'll get a plate of 12 pieces with potato chips. YUM!

When in Cebu, eat here and you will not go to KFC or even Jollibee. They are the BEST place for Fried Chicken in Cebu! Tip: Don't be shy! Use your hands to eat ever bit of chicken. ;)","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

I came in expecting the worsr since this is kind of a fast food chain ramen joint. A ramen bowl at 150 pesos seems unheard of, so of course I had to give it a try.
The broth does not taste like it has a lot of ingredients like the expensive places, but what ingredients that were placed can be tasted, especially the fresh ones. The pork was tender and even more tender than ikkousha ramen cebu! The gyoza was really basic but edible, and if you opt for side order of plain rice at 25 pesos its a great meal!
I will definitely be stoppibg by from time to time for a budget meal to satisy the ramen craving.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

Came here as a late night treat and had their desserts and hot drinks with the fam. Although the weather is hot and sticky, the restaurant is cold that you'd rather opt for something to keep you warm while enjoying a warm chocolate cake. In fact, they make a variety of American desserts but also a mix of pinoy favorites (Ube! Pandan! Mango! Yehey!). In that instance, I saw their pandan gulaman and had to try... It blew my mind! Lots of delicious jellies in a nice creamy constancy in a small glass jar. Really nice touch there. In the states the (Asian) puddings are usually the typical mango and milk flavor, but Pinas, you got it down! My sweet tooth was fulfilled and I am wanting more!

Love the space. Very cheery and bright. Great spot to bring your girlfriends, family, or a date if you're a big sweets fan. There's plenty of tables to accommodate.

Finally, the hot matcha latte really balanced the dessert. I have no complaints here. The customer service was excellent too.

Open late!

Like Joey, I've also had a lot of Cebu friends saying it's not authentic but just try it anyway. So here I ended up trying just for the experience.

The service was probably one of the best at any lechon place I've been to (I guess it's the only place which actually charges you a service charge).

The food is that they serve is definitely photogenic - being that the owner is a food blogger from Manilla, that doesn't surprise me. 

Would I return, not sure - but I do like that it's close to Mango Square, so it's a good eating place before going partying I guess. 

But despite the food being good and I also like boneless lechon - I prefer something more of a  ""local"" feel (that local cebuano people enjoy). After all, ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do""

But I do love the Kamias shake at Zubachon though.

So verdict, come here for the awesome experience, while still eating good food, and make sure you try the kamias shake.","","",""

They are located side by side. That in itself is great!

The food was quite tasty as to be expected, and for a group of fourteen people, they were able to accommodate us easily during a Monday dinner. We ordered 3 meal bundles (2 x 1400+ and 1,200+) from Golden Cowrie and the Vegetable Sisig and Pinaupong Manok from Salinas. Surprised with the bill total because for the sumptuous feast which we consumed, we still had change for the P5,000.-

So, we made up for the great service and yummy food by leaving a 12% in gratuity. Will definitely eat here again when we visit them.

When they would repeat my order for accuracy, they'd say ""I see you ordered our delicious hot mojos guaranteed to satisfy your craving, a delicious cold coke to satisfy that thirst."" That seems to be gone (thank god) on this trip.

As far as pizza goes in the PH, this is one of the better pizzas. They have a really good crust that I actually crave each time I come. The sauce is not sweet as I've found at other pizzas places. 

The mojos (deep fried potato slices) are frankly delicious and guaranteed to satisfy your craving *dang it!! It caught on!!* they are  delicious.

I don't eat chicken but hear they have good chicken.  All fried chicken in the PH comes with gravy. I'm sure that's a good thing. I've never said no to gravy.

Their hot sauce I absolutely love. I try to steal a bottle every time I'm there. I've been caught at customs with too many before and had to throw some away....ok, it was really an accident. I forgot I had some on my carry on and you can't bring open liquids on the plane.

We were staying at Tsai and saw adverts stating that guests get a 15% discount, so we decided why not.

You order at the front then wait for your food to arrive at your table. We advised the cashier we stayed at Tsai and showed them our room key, they had another promo going on where you buy a drink and a meal you get dessert for 1 peso. We opted for the meal+drink promo, apparently you can only choose either or for the promos. Either you do the 15% off for being a Tsai Hotel guest or you choose the combo promo, you can't have both. 

We ordered chicken parmesan, chicken pesto (creamy), a latte, hot tea, strawberry cake, and chocolate cheesecake. The spaghetti for the chicken parmesan packed flavor. You can taste every bit of garlic.. yum! Chicken was moist and tender in the inside and crispy out. The chicken pesto was equally as good. Chicken was also moist and tender, sauce was of good consistency. The strawberry cake was off the chain, it was so soft and you can actually taste the strawberry flavor. Cake was of good portion. The chocolate cheesecake bar was ok, the size was more on the side of like 1 bite or 2, but the bar itself was also moist. 

I'd say Tazza is of convenient location if staying at Tsai and will come back again to try their other menu items.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

Ngohiong is kind of like a fried egg roll but the filling is simpler usually from part of coconut plant i believe. They also offer fried chicken which has a simple coating, you can choose from what they call ""bisaya"" native chicken which is smaller in size and like a free range versus the ""bantris"" which is bigger size and the grocery kind.

The place is only open from 730am to 130pm. So if you want to try a local favorite, come and try.

So I sat and watched her eat and sometime later she sat and watched me eat. UNACCEPTABLE!

No one said anything about the huge amount of time difference between the meals. No explanation no aknowledgement that anything was wrong, REALLY? 
Even McDonald's does better than that. 

I asked to speak with the manager but my wife was tired of waiting and we left.  If I choose not to return you should know why.

I couldn't wait to try it. Well I'm in LA I found some Lechon being grilled over live coals at a street vending location. I tried it and it was excellent. I couldn't wait to get a chance to try it in Cebu. The first place I tried it was in the mall near where I was staying and it was decent but not as good as the in Manila. I decided to try House Of Lechon because of the reviews and because it was within walking distance to where I was staying. I was expecting it to be at least as good as what I had in Manila. I was a little bit disappointed however.  The Lechon was served cold but still not bad, not great but not bad.  A young lady soon came over and asked me w it was and I told her it was cold.  She took the plate and had it heated up, I assume in the microwave.  Parts were a little chewy likely due to the microwave.  Other pieces were very tender.  I am a fan of the skin but that was not very crisp so couldn't eat much of that.  Also probably due to the microwave. 

Overall I was a bit disappointed.  I don't think it was cooked over coals either.  The vegetable dish I ordered was very good. It reminded me of spinach.  I did have to find an employee to take my order but that is not unusual.  When I was ready to pay I just went to the cashier.  The place was very clean even the bathrooms.  They have a lot of seating indoors and out.  By the way the menu has much more than just Lechon or pork for that matter.","","",""

Not sure what authentic should feel like but this restaurant felt authentic considering I was the only foreigner there... One of the waiters is an interesting one - done up in a lot of make up and apparently very flirtatious and seems like he's a staple of the restaurant per their Facebook page... Anyway the native chicken cooked on these little grills but the chicken themselves are tiny - you probably need about one chicken a person. They have a lot of other grilled and friend foods including various fish - milkfish was the only one I recognized. We also tried the ceviche (local name I don't remember) but extremely good!! You should also try the puso which are the individually packaged rice which are local to cebu....

They also served a tastiest thin flour crisps. We had the Italian sausage pasta which was really good. The sauce was a bit creamy, perfect blend of spices and not too tangy.  The Asparagus creme soup was also very good. I just wish they had more bits of asparagus, because it could have also passed for a mushroom creme soup.  We were a bit surprised at the cost of the dish. It was about P500 a plate.

When we arrived around noon, the inside of the restaurant was packed. Luckily the restaurant was really big, and there was plenty of outdoor seating. Despite it being really hot and humid, the outdoor fans did a good job of making the temperature tolerable. I had an overall positive experience of the place. Customer service was good, and the food came out 15 min after we ordered. We ordered 1/4kg of spicy lechon, crispy chicken skin, mixed vegetables, and bam-I bisayas. 

I would definitely go as far saying that the House of Lechon's lechon was the best I've had... even better than lechon back at home in the US. The spicy lechon had such amazing flavor from all its seasonings. The skin was crispy, and the meat was very tender. 

Chicken skin is the best part of fried chicken, am I right?! Had to get it as the appetizer. It was exactly as advertised, and I was good with that.

The mixed vegetables dish was totally fine. I got it since I needed some vegetables in my life, so it was a plus that it more than exceeded my expectations. The vegetables included cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and bell peppers. They were all stir fried in oyster sauce. 

Lastly, the bam-I bisayas was delicious. It had a mix of bihon (skinny rice) noodles and Canton (thick egg) noodles. I'm used to pancit being dry, so I liked how this version of pancit was kind of soupy.","","",""

After checking in to our room and getting partly settled in, we decided to grab dinner before the restaurant closed for the night.

We showed up around 9 PM & were nicely greeted by the hostess out front.

Our server was also very friendly and accommodating.

I ordered the pepperoni pizza for my daughter, which she ate just the pepperoni.  The pizza is actually a little on the sweet side, which isn't my style.

I got the grilled salmon, which was actually very good.  It came with a side of ratatouille and puréed pumpkin, which was also very good.

This place offers both buffet style and a la carte so you can choose which fits your appetite.

Pretty good food and conveniently located inside our hotel!","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

The food was basically ordered for us before we got there.  Soup with clams in their shells & veggies.  Cubed pork, kang-kong, shrimp, & stuffed crabs were all tasty.  My wife enjoyed the roasted chicken in pandan leaves the best.  My choice was baked tahong (mussels) with cheese & garlic - - a little bit too cheesy for me, but still tasty.

You order at the counter,  and they provide the ingredients sauce for you to cook in the wok. Azul also provides a one burner, portable stove. Once cooked, you then dip then sauce with ""Puso"" - a rice, covered and braided with bamboo leaves,  cooked slowly in coconut water.  This rice dish is only found in Cebu, and it's what the locals eat daily as their rice staple. Best to also eat with your hands.  It's how the locals eat it.

There are instructions how to cook the sauce at the wall. Azul also has inihaw (grilled in charcoal), cooked squid, seafood, and the famous Filipino Sisig dish,  made from parts of chicken and pig. I was surprised they also provide dim sum and they cook this for you.  Actually,  it was delicious. There are indoor and outdoor dining area, but it's best to eat outside as it can get warm indoors.

It is expensive my Filipino standard, ranging 500-700 php per pizza, but you can tell the ingredients are top notch. The pizza oven is really cool, too.
My only minor complaint is that the pizza was a bit sparse on toppings. For example, only two basil leaves that were left whole and not spread around to all the pieces. The flavor of the crust and sauce more than made up for it, tho. 
I'd come back whenever I'm in the mood for high quality fire burned pizza.

The staff is the best and always makes us feel so cared about. There is regularly live music in the later evening, but if it's not your jam, just sit outside and it's quieter. Really supportive of the community, local artists, the environment, and Cebu.
The thin crust pizza is delicious. It's very unique, so don't expect classic Italian thin crust or you'll be disappointed. But to me, this is Cebu's pizza. I'm vegetarian so I usually get cheesy cheese with added pineapple. But the Handuraw special is the must-try classic. Besides pizza, there's a menu of other local favorites.

On Saturday nights, we usually call ahead and reserve for a big group of at least 13 people. There was a mix-up when we arrived, apparently our reservation table had been given away. We were late for about 15 minutes. The waiter claimed that since we were late, they had to give the table away. My cousin argued that it should have been proper for the restaurant to call us before giving our table away.

Luckily, we didn't wait long (about 15 mins) until two tables opened up to accommodate us. Other than that little mix-up, this is one of the better Shabu Shabu houses in Cebu. Their cuttlefish ball, squid ball, beef with mushroom ball, and several cuts of beef and pork are some of the better quality. Making your own sauce is always one of the highlights for everyone before the meal is served. The kids enjoy it, and even the older adults. The service is pretty fast, and time is just taken up by cooking your own meats and vegetables. It's not just fun, but it's also a healthy choice.

Tip: Sweet Little Things next door is great for your sweet tooth fix after the meal.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

They function primarily in a buffet format, but you do have the option of ordering a la carte. Obviously, if you order room service, as I did on one particular night, you order a la carte.

The ""cream"" certainly was on the thinner side and somewhat bland, but it provided a much lighter meal than anticipated for a late-night which was welcomed. Jasmine rice on the side was added on as extra. 

We went down on another occasion for breakfast as it was still the more convenient option considering that in order to get to Ayala mall, one must cross a very busy street with a high potential for death. Their *Tapsilog* was grilled perfectly with the inclusion and added flavoring of sauteed veggies. With the usual garlic rice and two eggs, they served a pickled atchara on the side. Dishes are a little pricier here, but you suck it up since it's the most accessible option. The atmosphere seems more high-end, but one is still able to walk-in casually and still receive utmost customer service. Plenty of tourists here as it is in a 3-star hotel.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

I got to try this place. It just opened recently around July of this year but I never had the chance to try it out; and now that I finally had the chance...it didn't disappoint! The place and ambience was modern and blended in with the other restaurants in the area. There weren't too many banchan offerings though but that wasn't a problem. The important thing is that as long as they have good kimchi, I'm good with that. The food was astounding! They're as authentic as you can get. One notable dish was their Beef Galbi Jjim. Out of all the Korean restaurants I've been to here in Cebu, this is the only one that has legit Beef Galbi Jjim. The other dishes I tried are worth mentioning as well; the pork from the Osam Bulgogi and Jeauk Bokkem was tasty, tender, and of good quality while the Duenjang Jjigae (soup) was flavorful and boiling hot (just what I like and what it should be). The Mandu (dumplings) was juicy and the ratio of meat was balanced well with the wrapper. The Jajangmyun was as expected. It wasn't the best I had but still satisfactory. To finish it all off, they gladly offered a complimentary Korean fish shaped ice cream sandwich called Samanco. Overall, I'd definitely come back again and also try their other dishes.","","",""

Some waiter turned off our grill even though we were still getting food and did not even bother to bus our dishes. And to top it off they turned off the 2 ACs near us. We had to ask them to turn everything back on. I guess they REALLY want you out the door asap.

When I saw the Shawarma place at SM City Cebu mall, I just had to check it out.  They have a very limited menu.  All they sell are two Shawarma Wraps.  Either Original or Bbq flavors, and you can add cheese for a few more pesos.  I was hoping they would have lamb as one of their choices, but all they had was beef.  So I ordered their Original Beef Shawarma Wrap with all the toppings/fillings and spicy sauce.  Sat down at their one table, and ate my Wrap.  It was yummy!  I liked it so much that I ordered two more wraps to go.  Tasted even better the next day!!

In a way I lucked out as I was able to finally try the famed BAKED BBQ PORK BUNS on my last trip to Cebu without having to wait in agony for their doors to open at Diamond Jamboree Plaza, Irvine. Served hot and fresh, a tip is to break it apart first to let the steam come out and cool down a bit before touching your lips. The bread itself is glorious with high marks on texture and taste while the bbq pork was sweet, savory, and just delicious. For this alone, now I understand why the Hong Kong location has been awarded a Michelin star; the cheapest restaurant yet.

Featuring mainly dim sum dishes, I pleasantly devoured their siumai, vermicelli roll with shrimp, pan fried radish cake, spare ribs rice, wasabi prawn dumpling, and dumpling in spicy sauce. I wouldn't say they're the best I've had as most are comparable to what I can get from Chinese restaurants here, some even better. 

So long as you're here for those buns, you won't be disappointed. True story.","","",""

Referring to a suckling pig that is roasted. The pig is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The pig is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a rotisserie action. The pig is roasted on all sides for several hours until done. The process of cooking and basting usually results in making the pork skin crisp and is a distinctive feature of the dish.

Prior to arrival, I heard nothing but goodness about this place. I've lived in this area quite long time ago but never tried the lechon probably I wasn't adventurous enough as I am today. I was excited to be back in town along with my brother and sisters. We've been out early doing a usual tourist stuff and it was lunch time when we decided to visit the place.

 Upon entering we're greeted with one of the staff. It was a little busy, luckily there was one table waiting for us. We were directly seated and order.  As for visit , we order the famous lechon, pinakbet ( made from mixed vegetables in steamed fish or shrimp paste ), and diniguan  ( pork blood stew ). I thought the entire dish was delicious. The lechon itself was extremely well seasoned. The meat was tender and the skin was crispy. I love every bite of it. As for dessert, we ordered the ube cheesecake and special halo-halo. It was creamy and tastel absolutely divine.

What a great visit. I also have to commend the fantastic customer service. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu. Very friendly and polite. I will definitely come back","","",""

The original location is in the Capitol area, but I've heard about this place for about the last two years and now they were clever enough to open a location in it park. The setup seems simple, big open space and barbecue area on corner. They were also clever to isolate the barbecue area like a smoking room so you don't smell like barbecue after a meal.  It has to be in the sauce or choice of meat since it visually looks the same except for the saice they use which is dark black ad opposed to the typical bright red. But despite the plenty of barbecue places om cebu this place seems to be popular and becoming a neighborhood favorite.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

Our local driver took us to this branch across from SM Cebu City. It's a bit unassuming as it's in a yellow building on top of a parking garage!

A decent amount of locals came in for a weekday lunch. I wasn't in charge of the ordering but we just tried their lechon and nothing else.

I was a bit disappointed with the skin, as I was hoping it'd be crispy and fatty juicy. Instead it was a bit tough and hard to chew. But the actual meat itself was delicious. Mix it with patis or suka and you're good to go.

If you're ever in Cebu, CnT is a good starter for a taste of Cebu's specialty lechon!","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

To be honest, there were no standouts, but luckily nothing was horrible. I took a pic of the ""pick your meat"". Any one of those picks were P150 plus more.  The wait staff were confused and when I asked for a refill of the kimchi, it never returned.

The food is good, it's Hawaii good, but definitely good enough. 

I was more excited with the fact this restaurant has in upstairs area. It's basically a tree house style. The ambiance is amazing. 

Definitely get the loco moco and the short ribs! And bring some friends and have some drinks. Great place to hang out at night!","","",""

Get their brewed coffee. Some of the best coffee I had in my life! Food wasn't bad, but they were completely out of the first three things I tried to order. I liked their combination of French and Japanese fare.

So we ordered a Mt. Apo boodle for the 7 of us.  The food came out quickly and it was a site to behold (see accompanying pictures)!!!  It was a massive plate of garlic rice, fish, meats, etc and soup in a coconut shell. The food was more than enough for all of us.  And it was really flavorful and delicious too.  All the food lent to each other and accompanied each other.  We also had a whole chicken which was moist and delicious as well.  The unlimited ice tea was good and refreshing especially while eating all these hot fried foods. 
Service was fast.  The people were nice and attentive to our needs.  Im sure if i ate with my hands it wouldve been even more of an experience!! Overall this place left me full and satisfied!!!  It is a must try when in cebu!!","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

I'm admittedly a neat freak and cleanliness is a big factor anywhere I go. BUT, if the food and experience is great, I won't even care if there was a cockroach seated next to me (seriously!). Larsian is a big barbecue center located in Fuente Osmeña Circle in Cebu. As soon as you enter the center, you will be greeted by throngs of stall owners inviting you to check out and choose from their wide array of ""ihaw-ihaw"" or grilled meat, poultry and seafood. Basically, it is THE one-stop barbecue place in Cebu! 

Since all their meat and seafood is on display, you are guaranteed that the food is fresh. There are long tables & chairs designated to each stall; In the middle, you see all the grilling stations. I suggest you pick a stall that is furthest away from the middle, unless you want to small like barbecue too. :P When you are seated, a stall attendant will give you native plates lined with plastic, plastic gloves (yes, you are expected to eat with your hands!) & a basket of ""puso"" (rice cooked inside cone-shaped coconut leaves, Php5/0.11USD per piece). 

My friends and I always end up ordering the same grilled items: chicken (Php50/1.07USD per stick), Cebu Chorizo (Php5/0.11USD per piece), Bangus or Milkfish (Php120/2.57USD, depends on the size) and other grilled meat here and there! Everything is very cheap! :) I recommend that you MUST order the chicken and the Cebu Chorizo. You will not regret eat those with your hands with 3-4 puso too.

To me, dining at Larsian is more about the experience you will have while eating with your friends. There are other more mainstream restaurants that will serve better grilled dishes. But, with the cheap prices and the atmosphere, it's certainly worth the visit! Sobrang Sulit! ;)","","",""

It's an American style casual dining restaurant. This branch is the original and was the ancestral home of the owners. The food is very affordable and the servings are HUGE (unless you can eat a 9-inch burger by yourself)! All the food they serve is good for sharing with friends. :)

When my fiancee, brother and I ate here, we were accompanied by a local. So, he ordered for us the best of the best dishes. We had Brians Ribs aka the ""Once you taste me, youll never forget me..."" Ribs. It's hands down their best seller! Baked pork ribs with a sweet, tangy piquet sauce served with rice and a side corn and carrots. The meat was tender and falling off the bones. Of course, the boys wanted burgers and Casa Verde has BIIIG burgers! We ordered ""The Big Bang Burger"" - 9-inch burger topped with onions, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, American cheese on a sesame-seed bun. Yes, sharing recommended. :) If you think that's big, they have a BIGGER burger called ""The Mighty Ton""! It's a kilo of our USDA tenderloin patty stuffed into their homemade 12-inch bun with 125 grams of bacon, an overload of american cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sauteed onions and mushrooms. Plus, you have a choice of barbecue, cheese or sour cream fries.

To go with your meat dishes, they also have appetizers and pasta. I skipped all that and went straight to their milkshake! They serve a very special milkshake called the ""Milky Way."" If you look at the photo I uploaded, it is, again, BIG! They claim it's ""The Biggest Milkshake In Town!"" It's basically a chocolate shake with lots of extra chocolate bits added in. Best served with their big bang burger! Note: You have to ask the server if the Milky Way is available because they have limited TALL glasses. I waited for mine. Took about 20 minutes. Worth the wait! 

In the end, we ended up bringing home a few ribs and half of the burger (except for the milkshake! I finished it :P) and had it for breakfast the next day. If you're heading to Cebu, try this place. They have a few branches now but, I enjoyed eating at the original location. Again, you Must Try their all time best-seller the Brian's Rib! :)","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

After entering the garage to park, take a left then head straight. There will be another entrance to the mall that will get you closests to Denny's as you ascend the escalators.

I've been through many Denny's in my lifetime to say that this Denny's decor was more modern than the ones back home we frequent after clubbing. Much cleaner too. 

A quick glance at the menu were short on offerings. So it seems like it was a Denny's on the go kinda thing. Anyway we ordered fish & chips, churro waffles, a chicken fried steak burger, and arroz caldo (rice porridge with chicken). For drinks one of the few restaurants that understood water with lemon. The food arrived and everyone sampled each other's order. Consistant throughout restaurants or any food joints in Cebu I been to, salty. I mean this was way overboard salty. Like the cook relentlessly poured salt on every single micro inch of the food. We did advise the waitress to let the cook know, next time to ease off the salt. I mean they did have the standard salt and pepper shakers that most, if not all, American restaurants have at the table. So one can suppliment if one feels the food needed a boost. Aside from the saltiness, the fish and chips were good and crispy came with a wedge of lemon too. The Churro waffles were sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar (and enough salt that you can notice its there) and you are given a tiny portion of chocolate to dip your waffles with. The chicken fried steak burger was a little on the dry side and a portion of the burn was close to being burnt. The arroz caldo was generously topped with chicken, scallions, and fried garlic. 

Staff: All were very helpful and quick when you ask them for something. Very polite. One lady did try to sell us some type of discount membership. At 2,000 pesos (about $40 usd) you get a discount of items ordered at Denny's and TGIF. I do not frequent these restaurants much to warrant buying a discount membership, so we declined the offer. Free wifi both inside Denny's, and the mall also has its own (limited) free wifi. Mall parking is 20 pesos.","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

The location in Ayala Mall Cebu was great.  You can sit inside or outside.  Outside, you get a good view of the park in Ayala Mall, it is in the higher floor and at night it is breezy.  Inside, you get the air conditioning.  During Christmas time, they have dancing lights at the park.

We ordered the palabok, bangus sisig and garlic rice.  The palabok was very saucy.  It was a bit salty and did not have that much ground pork on top, it also lacked the chicharon.   However, the size was great and can fill you up. You can sprinkle the calamansi on top of the palabok to cut down on the saltiness.  

The bangus sisig was a bit salty as well, but that's where the rice comes in.  It comes on a sizzling plate, which is a nice sight to behold.  The garlic rice is a great alternative to plain rice.

If you just wanna chill and have a snack, they have bucket beer specials. 
This would go great with their pork sisig, which is apparently one of their bestsellers.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

Instead of earning $$ today the owner lost $$ due to his/her staffs incompetence. We ordered their gigantic burger (thinkin this will be just like nyc) unfortunately the waiter and manager told us verbatim that we can't order the gigantic burger coz it wouldn't fit at the bar. WTF is what I was thinking  so I suggested how about we cut in half coz we're not eating it as a whole it will eventually be sliced into two by my brothers. Both waiter and manager said no and was adamant that it's huge and suggested to order something else. We all cracked up. I couldn't help it I told them ""you'd be fired if I was the owner right there and there. I mean you demonstrated you don't have the greatest customer service now we've established you're completely incompetent."" Not recommending this establishment!

This is the first place we stopped at when we first landed in Cebu. It's open pretty late. They have a lot of food choices so for those of you who aren't used to eating more foreign type of foods, there's definitely things on the menu that you can enjoy. I would highly recommend everyone visit here if they're ever in Cebu, just for the view alone. I'd also recommend going at night because it's alot nicer to see the overview of the entire city at night with all of the lights from the buildings. Very romantic place also. Saw a lot of couples and even some people having their own picnics.","","",""

Try their chicken inasal, longganisa, and pork barbeque (large is php18.00 and small is php10.00).

They also serve local beers so it's best for those who would like to drink during or after dinner.

The restaurant was jam packed with customers dining both inside the restaurant and outside.  There was no delay in the food coming out.  These folks are fast and efficient.  The quality of the food did not suffer also.  Everything we had was good.  My favorites this visit were the bread and the noodles.  Sorry, but I do not remember the name of each entree.

I can highly recommend dining at Majestic restaurant at the Ayala Center Terraces.  Even for a large group the service was good, food tasted delicious, and the prices were very affordable!!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

As Ayala Mall transformed itself to what it is now, this restaurant was there from the beginning.

The menu is primarily Filipino cuisine. If you like pork, I suggest the Crispy Pata, if you are into veggies, they have a dish which is composed of steam vegetables (can't remember name"" but its on the menu, they also have seafood dishes, and a dessert menu based on traditional Filipino dessert. 

The dishes they offer are what you will see in most Filipino restaurants, but the the preparation, ambiance, and friendly service will make you a loyal customer if you appreciate such things. Take note, there are two locations in Ayala Mall one is part of the Mall, the other the one I'm writing about is part of the ""Terraces"" which is composed mainly of eating places. 

So if you are looking for a place to try Filipino dishes in a calm and family setting, then be sure to give this place a try.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

This specific branch is the first branch that they opened and probably the only branch left that is owned by the original owner(s) (the other branches are owned by random franchisees). Up until now, many would flock towards this place(mostly locals) especially after going to church on a Sunday. They haven't changed much since I've been here ever since I can remember. The memories I've had since childhood will always be remembered. The feel/ambiance of it is just that of a classic diner especially with the checkered tablecloths. I usually order the classic (3pcs assorted chicken (you can choose your preferred cut) with potato wedges, coleslaw, and rice) or the prime cuts thigh (3pcs thigh with potato wedges, coleslaw, and rice). The chicken itself is good and flavorful enough without the need for gravy or any sauces but many usually dip it in ketchup or a mix of ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce since it can enhance the flavor. Other than their chicken, they have choices of appetizers and others. Their liver and gizzard, chicken skin, and calamares(fried squid rings) are one of the popular ones. The sotanghon guisado in this specific branch is, in my opinion, better than the ones in other branches. Chop suey is always a crowd favorite if your looking for some veggies to add to your meal. I don't usually order dessert but my aunt usually orders their halo-halo(she likes it). Prices are reasonable but for those with a tight budget, they also offer combo/value meals(comprise of a mix of assorted dishes like chicken, noodles, and vegetables). If given a choice, as much as possible, I probably would prefer eating in this branch rather than the other branches located throughout Cebu but all of the branches are equally as good(it's just a personal preference).","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

With that same recipe, Zubuchon was born... and it's greatness, as declared by Bourdain, is one that I experienced... and have confirmed! 

You can order the classic pig, or boneless, by the ""platter"". A small platter stated to serve 2 and was P340. The *Fast Meal* sounded grander though as it did come with lechon, plus monggo soup, plain rice, and a side of acharra (fermented veggies). The serving of lechon came with two EXTRA crispy skins and a grand helping of luscious, melt-in-your-mouth and tasty pork. The monggo soup was quite savory and delicious, the chicharron on top giving it a bit of a crunchy texture. The added funk on the side with the acharra added another depth of flavoring. Multiple thumbs up with this meal... the lechon definitely shining! To keep the lechon as fresh as possible, lechon deliveries are made 2-3 times throughout the day. The dinner time lechon does deliver at 5pm, so if you come just before there is a chance it might not be ready yet, so do plan wisely!

With our appetites sated, we had to round off the meal with dessert. The *Zubuchon Dessert Platter* for P250 had all of the works -- leche flan, biko, budbud kabug, and two mango. Their biko was especially delectable and they made sure to drown it in brown sugar, haha. Everything was warm and yummy. We did indulge quite grandly here! There are several locations of Zubuchon. This one in the One Mango plaza is near some bars and karaoke bars, so I don't see why you couldn't hop over to them afterward.","","",""

Well you gather the whole family for a huge party at one of Cebu's rooftop spot.  It's no secret that rooftops get a bad rap here in the States because of idiots that think it's okay to act like a bunch of high schoolers at an elegant location with a view, but in Cebu I finally know what it means to party with people who actually have manners.  No overly rambunctious, rude hooligans just my huge family mingling it up with some foreigners and locals enjoying the scene.  Whatever others may rate it, in my book Blue Elephant at the Apple One Sky Lounge simply deserves nothing but a perfect five.  For giving my family a party to remember, Blue Elephant will be a prime spot for me every time I make my way to Cebu.

Blue Elephant is located on the 19th floor of a very prominent building near Ayala Mall in Cebu.  One thing to know beforehand is the importance to have a Visa card when you visit.  The reason is if you use Visa to pay for your visit then they wave the cover charge...so you better use your Visa. (Btw I am in no way working as a promoter for Visa; it's just my tip to help fellow travelers out.)  The décor of the building is very chic and modern.  I don't know how else to describe it but it's a typical rooftop.  What I mean is it has every element of a rooftop location: unparalleled view of the city below, neon and strobe lights throughout, tropical trees that add some greenery, and a DJ that's mixing Top 40s as well as other throwbacks.  Add to this some great servers and food coming out from the kitchen and you got a recipe for an awesome time.  I can only describe the scene so much but I feel that a picture can truly show the awesomeness better.

Now to the food.  Typical Asian flare with a bit of modern fusion touch.  I don't know what the dishes were to be exact because it was basically set for the party and on account that I had to be the obligatory hype man for the whole place which means I was too distracted to see what their menu entailed and see if I could match the dishes on the table.  But one thing that did stand out was their pad thai.  It was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  I literally had a whole plate...and then had another...and then one more for good measure.  Thankfully I was burning it off with some good ol' Dexter dancing.  Ya'll know what that looks like.  Another one was their seafood curry.  The dish had a delicate balance of curry flavor without overpowering the natural saltiness of the seafood.  Most importantly unlike other seafood curry that I've tried in the past, Blue Elephant's was not mushy.  There's nothing more unappetizing than mushy seafood curry.  Finally the third dish that I distinctly remembered was the Korean barbecue ribs.  My brother raved about how good it was and good thing I was able to grab my hands on a couple of pieces because the fam bam always beat me to.  As usual my bro knows his barbecue ribs.

I couldn't ask for a more amazing family.  I had not been back to the Philippines for almost two decades.  That is a long time not to see family back home.  So many things had changed but one thing has always remained the same.  No matter how long I had been gone, I never felt that I was a stranger.  It felt like we simply pushed life on pause and then hit play again.  And boy did we hit play.  I guess the reason why I party hardy is because of my family.  We press play and we press it hard.  And at Blue Elephant we did just that!","","",""

When I think of New Orleans cuisine, I think of Jambalaya.  For some reason, though, none of us ordered their Jambalaya.  We started out with the Oysters which were yummy!!  My mother n'law liked her Fish N' Chips. The Salmon was enjoyed by my wife and also my brother n'law.  The Tuna Melt that I had was ok.  Was more like a Tuna burger though.  Fries were delicious.  The Mango Shake was large and really good!!  Speaking of large, all the portions were huge!!  We all had leftovers to enjoy the next day.

New Orleans restaurant is a fine choice at Ayala.  Worth finding out if you like them too.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

The buffet choices were more than I am used to.  We don't have as many entree choices as Cafe Bai had in my hometown in California.  They cater to an international clientele.  They had food stations for a multitude of cuisines such as Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Western, and Filipino.  Literally something for everyone.  My favorite choices were the Filipino dishes.

I would love to dine at their Breakfast Buffet during future visits to Cebu.  So worth the value!","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

We stayed at Escario Central Hotel so this place was very convenient to get to. Just across the way. 

I originally wanted to order a white cafe mocha but the waitress stated its not available. uhmm ok, aren't you a cafe? Anyway we end up getting the caramel latte and it was on the small side. I guess I'm used to having a huge cup of java so when I see a cute little cup, it tends to be on the tiny side to me. Anyway the latte came in a clear glass cup and you can see the layers of ingredients. It was nice. The flavor didn't have a wow factor to it. Back home I brew my own and have a whole fridge full of torani syrups and ID creamers stocked up, so when i order or make a certain flavor I expect that flavor to be very apparent. This was like coffee made from a regular coffee maker and they quickly threw some flavorings in it. But hey atleast there was a little bit of coffee art. Anyway a caffeine addict is a caffeine addict I quickly consumed my cup despite the lack of flavor.

We ordered the ""fancy loaded french toast"" and ""Sausage"" meals, and what they lack in taste in their coffe made up for in their food. The french toast was huge and the condiments were separatly organized on the plate. I took a bite and the crunch was heaven, french toast was not soggy. yay! Inside filling was ham and cheese. So it was like a french toast sandwhich. Ham was a little greasy and dry and didn't seem fresh, but the french toast exterior was very good. I tried my wife's hungarian sausage plate and it was reminescent of the State Fair of Texas. Sausage on a stick. Packed of flavor! She was also pleased with her selection.

Service was a little slow despite that there weren't any other customers. Waitresses were friendly. I did notice that when we arrived one customer was leaving and the a/c blew cold, however when he left they turned down the a/c. Like uhmm ok are we to have less a/c? *shrugs* They gave us a clicker thing to ring them when I needed something, it made me feel awkward because it was like the remote control to their doorbell. The bell sound echoed throughout their cafe.  Overall I'd come back again and try their other menu items, but they need to improve in their coffee offerings both in taste and availability. 

Tip: They accept credit cards.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

Then they handed me a plate of boneless lechon and a plastic glove and I immediately understood.

By the third visit in three days I was pretty hooked.

It's not the best lechon you've ever had, but it's pretty darn good.

The place is clean and atmosphere is cozy. Our servers, Robie and Evangeline were very attentive and polite. While waiting for our food, we heard a woman's voice who sounded like she was throwing a fit in the kitchen. I asked Robie, the head waiter what was going on because I sensed that the other customers were quite tense and uncertain as to what was going on in the kitchen. It was truly a very unprofessional demeanor from LESLIE, the head chef. She was practically yelling at the top of her lungs to the kitchen staff and it made the other servers feel very awkward.
Other than this very unpleasant experience, the food was very good.  I would highly recommend this place.","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

In the Philippines, vegetables are hard to come by, so we jumped at the eggplant dish. It was far from providing the fresh, clean salad feel that we were craving, but was an excellent dish nonetheless. The eggplant was cooked until it was tender and the sauce gave us that savory comfort feel. Their star dish has to be the fried pork leg. The crunch on the skin in contrast to the juicy tender meat was to die for. Unfortunately the pork sisig was a bit of a let down, we asked for extra crispy sisig, but even after letting it cook for a while on the sizzling platter, it was still mushy in texture (though not lacking in flavor). The servers walk around with white rice to help wash down all the richness.","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

I love the photos on the wall and the books along the booth tables. There is a bright indoor area and a very spacious patio. 

Try the french kouign-Amann. It's like a croissant but 10x better. 

Chef Philippe is so warm and welcoming including his smiling staff! I witnessed a lot of local French friends coming in and out of the store to eat and relax as well. I felt very at home and like family!

First, I got the the chipped/broken sauce square implement, looks sharp and unsafe but I can live with that.  Living on the edge baby! There were 8 of us, and all drinks were provided except the easiest 1, the 3 glasses of calamansi juice. When it came, I did not get one, all the rest got theirs, why? It's a matter of simple math or just being aware that all have drinks except 1 and we have 3 attempts to get the waiters attention, 3 attempts until we got one's attention. It's early Friday night, we arrive around 5 pm but didn't really start eating until past 6 pm. We got our food in installments, even the Supposedly unlimited rice. He gave some of us but not all but saw the guy give in other table also. Why? Some of our food got cold while we wait for more dishes to come. I remember I ordered calamari that never came. The crispy para came last just when I got full. Most of the food tastes good but I was so hungry then that I question my judgment on food taste.

I had high expectations for this place, especially since the restaurant itself is called House of Lechon, but I have to say that the lechon did not meet my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the lechon had the crispy skin (which is nothing but deliciousness), and the meat itself was juicy, but I was hoping that it would have some more flavor on it's own. The dipping sauces are what really gives it its flavor. Put that over rice and you're good to go. 

The other dishes we ordered were average. I can't remember everything that we ordered, but it wasn't too impressive. Since my mom is originally from Bichol, and since I'm kinda biased on how it [the dish] should taste, I made sure that I didn't order the Bichol express here. I had Bicol express at another restaurant elsewhere in Visayas and was highly underwhelmed by it. To avoid a repeat of that, I made sure I didn't order it. Looking back at it now, I wouldn't mind trying it if I do dine here again. The halo halo shake, on the other hand, was a nice treat to enjoy with my meal. I still prefer the actual halo halo dessert though.

As with most places in the Philippines, the staff we interacted with were very friendly, polite, and helpful.

Overall, I had a good dining experience here, however I wasn't too impressed with the food. I wouldn't mind giving this restaurant another try though.","","",""

Also huge kudos to the fantastic bartender because their drinks are some of the most well made in the entire city.

A massive Pineapple slice overwhelmed the entire thing. 

I lived in Hawaii for four years, & never witnessed anything close to this; yes, we have pineapple & pork, pineapple on pizza, but hamburger and not cooked? NO!!! On a side note, the fries were good. 

Next, this location only took cash, no credit cards. So, it was like the 1980s in America. 

Finally, the service was blah, since they don't really make any suggestions. They just look at you rather puzzled, since everyone in the Philippines is familiar with this restaurant chain. However, it had been over 25 years since I have been in the Philippines. 

If you want to play it safe, stick with their version of fried chicken. It is called Chicken Joy Joy. Unlike American chains like KFC, Lee's, Church's and so forth that batter the chicken twice, Jollibee only has a thin coat. Perhaps, it is healthier, but still it's deep fried.

Finally, I would not recommend the spaghetti, since the sauce is like ketchup. In addition, the sauce has a hotdog cut up in it. Another oddity but a low budget addition; remember, you're in the Philippines at their version of a fast food restaurant chain. A lot of people go without in this country. When you're hungry you'll eat just about anything including an Amazing Aloha Burger.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

Once you enter City Times Square head towards the end and you'll find Tokyo Table.

Upon reading some reviews, I called to confirm their promotion where a birthday celebrant is complimentary. I called and advised that the birthday celebrant's birthday will be the following day but intend to celebrate it the day before. The man stated that as long as there were atleast 2 paying adults per 1 birthday celebrant, then indeed, they were complimentary. I asked to reconfirm and he stated, ""yes, birthday month is ok"". So off we went. I also notice that there was a 10% discount for checking in using yelp.

We arrived at about 6:30 pm. I advised I called earlier on the day regarding the birthday promo and said the birthday girl was with us in tow. 5 adults in total. She then said oh there needs to be 6 of you for the birthday celebrant to be free. I said thats not what I was told earlier. So she went to ask some other male receptionist as I stated I spoke with a man earlier. Long story short, There was only 5 of us so depsite the wrong info, everyone was charged including the birthday girl. I then showed them the yelp check in promo then they stated it was expired. By then I was like what in the %$*!! Anyway at 740 per person weekday dinner, paying for one other person was not gonna break the bank. It was just disappointing that one has to mislead the public in order for people to eat here. They asked for the birthday girl's i.d., which we gave, and she still had to pay. *womp womp* What was the point of asking for her identification if you still weren't going to honor your promo. Now on to the food.

Variety was way better than most other buffets in Cebu that I've tried. They had a mix of Filipino, Korean, Chinese, but mostly Japanese offerings. Everything I tasted was hot and flavorful. We opted to do hot pot but realized there was what they call a ""mookata"" (a heating utensil to cook both hotpot and yakiniku at the same time). Sadly, we only found out about the mookata at the end of the meal while sitting around trying to decide if we were gonna have another go at it. They also had a good selection of desserts that included my favorite, bread pudding. Their bread pudding was moist but lacked the custom bourbon or whisky sauce. It did have sauce though, just not sure what kind. The sushi had a different taste than what I've grown accustomed to. They added some kind of mushroom or something in one of their maki rolls. Haven't had that before (tasted strange). Their hot pot broth (we chose chicken) was seasoned a little salty but didn't mind it since we had veggies in there. Charge included drinks (even unlimited refills of San Miguel Beer, on tap) We asked for hot green tea, but stated it will be an additional 60 pesos added to the buffet price, but that you may have unlimited refills. I noticed at about 8:30ish the staff started putting up dinnerware. I thought they closed at 10 pm. *shrugs* I find it rude to be doing this while many patrons are still dining. Strange etiquette indeed.

Despite the annoyance in the beginning, food quality was pretty good and even rivaled with hotel buffets. Should you need to call them, I advise to ask for the person's name of whom you spoke with before hanging up to avoid a similar situation I endured. However, Jennabeth (receptionist lady) was very professional and warm. She was apologetic at the end. (Thank you for that, Jennabeth!) 

Restroom stalls are super tiny in the lady's room. So just an fyi if your used to Texas standard size restroom stalls. They also had only one sink. Are we to wait in line whilst someone is doing there makeup in front of said sink?!? *rolls eyes*

Free wifi, ask a waiter or waitress for the password. 20 pesos was charged for parking as you leave City Time Square.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

They do offer set menus at a reasonable price  if your not sure what to get. A notable feature is there use of ipads as menus and the staff are friendly enough to assist you in making choices. Fortunately the menu does have pictures and descriptions to decide.

On this first visit, I decided to order the pink peppered duck and a chocolate dessert. Again, I'm not an expert but it did taste delicious. I was told that the duck itself came from France so upon hearing that, I decided to order it. The duck was cooked well and to my satisfaction. The chocolate dessert was reminiscent of a warm brownie but it also was good.

They serve lunch and dinner at certain time frames but offer drinks and dessert throughout the whole day. A pleasant and tasty place to unwind and enjoy a good meal. Take note they advise making reservations if you decide to attend for dinner. The seating capacity is not that big which makes for a cozy experience.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Cooee is serves fruit and veggie meals and drinks with that millennial trend of fruit bowls and salads. The portions are huge and worth the price. I could barely finish my fruit bowl with pureed kale. All in all, it was a delicious vegan meal that stood out in the general area.

Monggo with Zebuchon  - it comes with cebuchon, good for cold weather. 
Adobong kangkong at chicharon - another favorite dish, very tasty and good combination with chicharon.
Fresh buko juice - its not cold, so disappointing
Mango shake and buko shake - very refreshing  
As we finish our order our server informed us they just got their delivery of cebuchon so, we got some for to go. Ate it the next day and just heat it up on microwave, oh my goodness is  very delicious and juicy.
Costumer service is good, friendly, and approachable.","","",""

Good service and good food. What else can you ask for?  Attentive and nice waiters/waitresses, food always came hot and fresh.  Gorged myself in their lechón belly, scallops, garlic shrimp, and a bunch of other Filipino dishes I don't know how to pronounce.  Will go here again if I come back to Cebu.

Like I said going back to a ""normal"" halo-halo will be really hard. 

Oh FYI for those that have been reading and wondering what halo-halo is don't fret I shall tell you.  This amazing concoction is a Filipino dessert consisting of shaved ice, palm fruit, jackfruit, coconut gel, other mixed fruits, sweet beans, flan, and topped off with ice cream that's either ube (sweet purple yam) or mango.  You then have the task of mixing it all together and trust me it's worth it at the end.

Anyways, I can only comment on the halo-halo at this restaurant because that's all I had.  We had eaten at a nearby restaurant already before coming here.  But based on my experience and the happy faces all around its a great place to grab a bite if even for just some dessert!","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

We always get the shrimp dumplings and the soup dumplings. Dip them in chili sauce and wow! Delicious! The seafood is always fresh. They have live fish, lobster, and even eel that you can pick from outside. May not be a good idea for animal
lovers though or for anyone not into that sort of thing, i mean seeing that their meal was alive just a few minutes ago.

But anyway, their food is really flavorful. And from what i hear, chefs are really from places such as hongkong etc and so the taste they put into their food is really authentic chinese. I got to try the spinach soup today too and it was surprisingly really good! They added egg, tofu and shrimp so it tasted more like a healthy egg drop! I loved it!  Gotta check this place out if you havent yet.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Service was quick and we were seated promptly. Waitress was courteous and eager to please.

Food: We both ordered the eggs benedict, and although the food was only warm, it was well seasoned. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce was good. I also ordered peach tea, which was reminiscent of P.F. Chang's dragon oolong tea back home in the States. My wife ordered a cappuccino which had a cute shaped heart in the center. 

2nd visit: We ordered the breakfast skillet and the beef brisket with kimichi. We're from Texas so we have a certain expectation when it comes to brisket. Yup, nope it's no Texas brisket but hey it still packed its own special flavor. Brisket was tender and moist. The breakfast skillet came with potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, bacon and some wonderfully flavored sausage. At first glance I thought to myself, "" whattt Texas toast!!"" but nope it was french toast. French toast was on the soggy side though. For beverages we ordered a mango caramel shake, which was soo good and the peach tea again.

The only complaint we had was that the food came out warm and not piping hot. ( 2nd visit was better, food arrived hot). Otherwise, We'll be back again to try their other offerings.

Tip: They have wifi and they accept credit cards.","","",""

I got grossed out and didn't finish it.

Since I love the cold noodle, I came back second time to give them another chance and this time, the noodles were way too hard and undercooked but they claim that's how they make it. I refused to eat because I'm afraid I might get stomach ache. Barely took 2 bites but it took them so long to finally decide to recook that dish for me.

Yup, they have one of the best lumi. This business used to be called Manila Restaurant located at Manalili st. Even though it's good, it's not like what it use to be. The flavor is almost as good as before but the meat content has significantly decreased. They've dumbed down their best menu. I remember when the soup was so thick and flavorful, now it's somewhat saturated. Their grilled pork belly was surprisingly good, and so is the siopao, which was soft and was adequately stuffed with meat.

Don't expect quality service though. Also better get your own tissue or napkin as theirs is so minute and thin, you have to use three pieces to wipe smudges or else it'll just shred.

I tried editing the business info as this is located at Mandaue City, Cebu, not Manila. It is in Parkmall of Mandaue. The yelp moderator hasn't paid attention to this yet.","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

When we found the place a guy immediately assisted us to the place where we will park. Thereafter, he instantly told us that we were in table 6. The staff here are polite and very attentive even when the place is full packed.

We got Noukou Korretti ramen which was already good for two! They allow sharing so it's a real bonus for me and my boyfriend because I usually can't eat a whole Ramen. The broth was really good!

Since we spent most of the day traveling, we didn't eat lunch,;so came here for a late meal around 4pm.  Because of so, we were the only ones dining in and as we were deliberating about what size of lechon to order, our server overheard us and told us that lechon is only available at dinner, an hour and a half away.  NOOO!  We clearly started to panic, which is when another employee got scared and said to our server that they had it so could serve it.  Thank the lawwwd.

Although the menu recommends a small lechon for two people, we ordered the medium size because we are fat Americans.  We also ordered a side of Pancit with Lechon and Eggplant Salad.  Nothing took long to make. 

Pancit with Lechon is Pancit Canton with pieces of lechon tossed throughout, and it was sooo good!  Obviously, I loved the bites of lechon the most, but the the egg noodles and veggies were scrumptious.  And it wasn't too salty or heavily sauced, which I appreciated.  Eggplant Salad was also very good, with a nice citrus flavor that complemented the smokiness of all the roasted pig we ate.  And speaking of, the lechon was uh-may-zzziiiing!  I knew it was gonna be good, but I didn't know it was gonna be THAT good!  The lechon was perfectly roasted, creating a tender, juicy meat with every morsel of a bite, and I loved that it was not overly salted, letting the pig do its thang.  And do not even think about skipping out on the crispy skin.  The crackle with the meat makes it all the more heavenly.  Like I said before, we ordered the medium size for two of us.  But pretttttty sure we coulda slaughtered a large size.  Do yourself a favor and just get the large size lechon.  Don't live in regret like me. 

Zubuchon was one of the best meals I had in the Philippines!  The lechon is what to order.  A large size at that.  Actually, scratch that.  Order a whole roasted pig, which you can actually do here!  Pork it up and get some of the wonderful sides to go with.  And lightly add some vinegar and calamansi to top it off.  Peace.  *Mic drop*","","",""

This was also another spot that I requested our tour guide to bring us to and I was not disappointed at all.

We showed up around 12:30 PM for lunch.

The five of us were seated immediately as the place wasn't too busy.

I ordered the aligue rice and the grilled pork belly as my main entree to share with daughter while the three guests ordered their own items to share.

I really enjoyed both of the items I ordered.  I also got to try the sizzling sinigang from their order, which I thought was ok.  The pork belly in this dish was actually what I was expecting my dish to taste like, but mine was still good.  I didn't really like the sizzling sinigang gravy poured over it too much though.

The food was actually good & the view was awesome, but service was hit & miss.  Some of the servers were friendly, while some kind of ignored us.  The worse one was the supervisor/manager, Ruth.  She was super rude and had her nose in the air the whole time we were there & asked for her assistance.","","",""

I even saw little cockroaches near the dining section. I just ate there yesterday and to my surprise they moved the buffet to the second floor and was astounded on the major improvement. Food and desert was b+ on my book (really good) area was clean ( very clean) Although buffet was good the store pricing on their products where on the high side. I purchased a bunch of Argao tableya ( chocolate tablets). Pricing was 280 pesos compared to 251 in SM city. She even claimed that you can't get any lower pricing from Argao. I don't mind the cost just didn't like the dishonesty of the owner ( old lady). So again if you come to this place the buffet is around 225 pesos per person which is reasonable just beware of the prices in the store especially the tableya or products that they don't produce it will be slightly higher better to purchase from SM which has really good pricing. For dried foods Carbon would be the cheapest if you don't mind the smell","","8","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=210"

My sister-in-law had been in contact with Gina and Chris way before we arrived. 
The night before the event we went to check on the place. It was clean and bright. There was the small function room that we reserved and if ever there was an overflow we could extend to outside. 
I was going to get charged just to keep the reservations which I was agreeable anyhow. 
That morning I got there 15 min. before 11 am and met up with Chris. I told him what I expect of the event-- just a few drink choices, my set menu that should be served sporadically and have my chicken pieces cut into 3. I wanted food served at 12 noon in a boodle style. He told me that Juvy was the my guy for the day. 
Guests started coming in and the next thing I know  they were serving the entire order already. They were taking drink orders left and right --who are we kidding? We know that drinks cost much more than food hence the reason why I wanted only couple drink choices. They were raking drink orders like there is no tomorrow. The grilled chicken were not cut into pieces. Hubby had to send back the same chicken piece 3 times as it still looked bloody!
So when I went up to Juvy and asked if Chris (the owner) had even relayed my message he said no. 
Unbelievable!!!
I even had Juvy call Chris and told him that they did not do what I asked them to do. 
Just after lunch we already raked in P13,000! That already pretty much set the entire day's arrangement. 
Dinnertime came and I had other set of guests came I sent my food orders. I reminded the staff to please just give couple drink options--never fails! The waiters started to take orders--until I found out and took matters into my own hands. 
We had to wait for our food for another 30 min!! Yes they had few Grab orders but 30 min!!! C'mon! The drinks we had to wait longer. The Iced tea was not ready!! Food came in after 30 min( we had to stand there and made sure we got our orders) and no iced tea in sight. Guests had nothing to drink. We cancelled the iced tea because they did not want them anymore. Just asked for water instead. The other food I ordered they were just going to cook and I don't know how long more it would take. This time everyone had stopped eating since the food took so long to come in. 
The staff were doing their best but looked overwhelmed. They were not understaffed but certainly were inefficient. They could use some more training. We had to literally ""help out"" since I could not stand watching and waiting for our water, clear out the plates 
At the end of the day I paid close to 20K! Asked for discount and they took off the corkage charge. 
Inspite of the experience my hubby still gave them a big 1k tip because he knew they worked hard. 
The 2 star was for the convenience and the space. 
Food could have been better and service NEEDS a lot of IMPROVEMENT","","6","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=150"

Group of seven seated after a thirty minute wait, it was a very busy evening for them and now we know why. We ordered beef nilaga, lechon kawale, adobong pusit, crispy crab  legs, lumpia, crispy pata, pork ribs, and eggplant salad. I honestly couldn't find fault in any of the dishes served, the nilaga soup was perfect, lechon was crispy, juicy, and absolutely delicious. The pork ribs were on the sweeter side but truly excellent. I really enjoyed the lumpia, it was well made and just perfectly cooked, an absolute delight with the sensation of crispy wholesome goodness. Overall this place blew past all my expectations for what good quality Filipino food should be and the staff handled everything well despite the really busy evening. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area and hope to see you there!

The lady and I ordered drinks, a cold mango smoothie and a pineapple mint smoothie.  The pineapple mint was simply divine, so freshly especially with that mint!  As for our entrees went with the Lechón pansit, sizzilin' Lechón sisig, half order of Zubuchon Lechón, and garlic rice.

Lechón Pancit: Pretty much your typical Chinese stir-fried noodles with bits of shrimp and cuts of Lechón.  It was waaaaay to salt for us! We had to down half our smoothies due to the saltiness.

Lechón Sisig: Came sizzlin' on a cast iron pan.  Very aromatic with tons of flavor. Only downside is that it was way to salty! You can't eat this without rice.

Zubuchon Lechón: Half order. Was surprised that it was just lukewarm and not all the skin was crispy! Some of it was chewy.  The flavor was alright so I had to dip it in my vinegar, soy sauce, lime, pepper mix.

Overall, the food was decent.  I was expecting to blown outta my mind.  Price was about 1200 Pesos so it wasn't bad.  Service was attentive. I like being called ""Sir"" everywhere I go, so empowering....haha. 

Went to Rico's next...","","",""

Bucket Shrimps offers a cajun flavour which has been fine tuned to Filipino taste buds.  It is a bit sweeter and absolutely bowl licking tasty.  It can be spicy or non-spicy.  There is also garlic butter flavour. 

As the name suggests, they offer buckets of shrimps.  But it does not end there, you can get crab, mussels, bbq pork, liempo as well.  So you can get both seafood and grilled pork items.  Eat this with rice.  There may be more on the menu, but we stuck to the above.

The concept is similar to restaurants offering cajun seafood boiled in plastic bags, but instead of serving the food in boiled plastic bags (which I have to admit is rather unappetizing), this place serves them in appetizing looking buckets :).  There are no utensils provided, they give you gloves.  There are no plates provided, you just put the food straight on the plastic table cover.  You can order beer here as well.

Everything was scrumptious and the location is just so unique for North American Standards, like an old school carinderia street food, with no quality being compromised.  Kamayan style, street food style, this place is really a different and fun dining experience!!!

Note: there may be kids who may come in and ask you to buy their items. This might take away from the tranquility of eating your food in peace.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

I google mapped it and it was pretty close to where we stayed ( further down escario) so we decided to take a jeep there. The location for this place is a little bit after Golden Peak Hotel, so if your coming from there it'll be on your right. 

We order their roast beef bahn mi and master beef ribs. bahn mi meat was on the dry side and I believe there was only one flavor. They did not include cilantro but I belive they did include cucumbers. Presentation was cute. My wife ordered the beef ribs and she stated it was just ok. For dessert I ordered an ice cream sandwhich and she a piece of ube cake. Now that was good. Ice cream sandwhich seemed to be pre-made as it was kinda stiff and chewy, however the chocolate cookie was tasty. Ube cake was moist and fresh.

Service was good and the waitress was very attentive and friendly. Overall I might come back to taste their other desserts.

Tip: they accept credit cards, and if you want to jeepney back you hafta walk a little ways.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

It's easy to see why Japanese tourists love coming to dine here - it's an authentic yakiniku experience. That means they do serve Kobe beef on the menu! Unfortunately that also means, to those sensitive of the issue, smoking is allowed while dining. Other than that, the meat quality is top notch. You get what you pay for.

Also, their grilled hamachi kama (hamachi head) is exceptional as well, but it is also subject to availability.

I can't believe I've let this review go so long without finishing and posting it.  

There's so much to be said but I think I can sum up my opinion about Iamik's by simply saying, this place is amazing and reasonably priced.  When I'm working in Cebu, I go two or three times a week, it seems.  Everything I've ordered is delicious, especially the nut chicken, cordon blue, and nuggets.  

My only minor complaint is that they have almost no veggies on the menu but, this is kinda common for The Philippines, from what I've seen (and I've been three times in the last year, equalling about two months). Iamik offers a cucumber salad which, we always order.  I like the vinegar that comes with it. I wish he'd throw some carrots and ranch dressing, corn on the cob, or even just sliced tomatoes in the mix.  THAT would be amazing. haha 

The music is always great, and if you go around 5 or 6 when they open, it's usually really chill.  The later it gets, though, the more it fills up with folks who are definitely there for the fun and beer.  

I'll definitely see ya there!","","4","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=90"

If you like barbecue. Then come here please. You pick the meat or fish you want them to bbq for you. And then they bring it to you and eat. You can also have the fish either grilled or turned into soup. It is an experience i haven't had before and i am glad that my friend brought us here. At first the place looked skeptical because it definitely looked like a wet market. But from my experience, skeptical usually means great food. 
Place can be crowded and loud because of people barking at passerby's in an attempt to get them to eat at their stalls. There are also alot of flies because it is outdoors and the place is a bit dirty lookin. 
The great side about this place is that the food is cooked deliciously!!! It was amazing.. i kept eating and eating. I was definitely surprised on how good the food came out. 
If you are a picky eater or someone that may want to make sure what you are eating is 100% taken care of an sanitary. You might lose your mind in this place cuz i personally doubt that this place is clean, but it is probably safe to eat to some extent. Place gets crowded late at night. 
I'd come back here. A must go place for when you are in the city.","","",""

Larsian serves grilled food and barbeque - chicken, fish, pork, longganisa, hotdog, and anything that can be grilled.

We went there and saw a cockroach flying from one stall to the other and then crawling all over the food on display!

They have a good selection of cakes, cookies and other pastries which are all pretty good. I like that cakes are mostly moist. They also have bubbles teas and so far the Taro i have had before tasted quite good. I tried the green tea latte but it tasted really sweet i had to add water twice to lessen the sweetness. And thats saying something to me coz i have a sweet tooth..or teeth more like.

But despite that, since i do like the kind of place that it is and what they offer i'll still give them a decent 4 star.","","9","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=240"

A group of 4 Korean friends own Café Noriter. They came to the Philippines for a vacation, fell in love with the country and decided to stay. :) 

The number one reason why I loved this place is because of the cute interiors and homey feel. ""Noriter"" means ""playground"" in Korean and that is definitely the vibe of the place! Inside, the space is maximized by having a second floor which is divided into little hangout spots. Seriously, it's like a playhouse! There are stuffed toys everywhere, you can write on the walls, and many small rooms for you to hang with your friends! Such a happy place :3 

The café offers a simple menu of coffee and simple dessert. The best-seller is their Java Chip and Caramel Macchiato. I somehow almost always order the Mango Smoothie. BUT, the one thing you MUST EAT here is the Honey Bread. I have tried other honey bread in other Korean cafés in Manila. They do not compare to the honey bread here. It's crispy on the outside but pillowy soft on the inside with the right amount of sweetness. Yummy-ness :D Also, they offer FREE WiFi. So, the last time I was here, I stayed from 3-730PM. It was just such a chill place to be. :)

Café Noriter offers what people look for and need in a coffee shop, a cozy ambiance. It just feels great to have a place to share good laughs with friends over coffee and stuffed toys. For those who are young at heart and love coffee, this café is a good place to bring out the kid in you! :D I hope you will love it as much as I do!","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

seems to be a lot of buzz about tourism im Japan, but since I am unable to visit at this time I decided to visit Japanese places in Cebu. The two dishes I orderes the takoyaki and okonomiyaki i have seen on various videos of Japan and their street food so I decided to give it a try. The takoyaki was better than expected and as I watches them make it I could tell they were on the right track. I could taste the independent ingredients in harmony. The okonomiyaki also tasted good. The flavors were not overpowering but at the same time you can discover the nature of its intent.
Its a great place to stop by for a snack and imagine you are in Japan since they do claim to be authentic. I plan to try the other location for their ramen dishes. Note at current time they have 2 other actual restauranr locations one at ayala and one in mandaue.","","7","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=180"

They serve authentic filipino dishes and desserts. We always get the crispy kangkong which is deep fried water spinach for our appetizer. Yes it is definitely greasy but it is sooo good especially when paired with the dip it comes with. The entrees are well-known filipino ones such as lechon kawali, ""bistek"", pancit, squid (cooked according to your liking) and the like.

We also thoroughly enjoy they merienda (""snack"") menu and go for their pancit palabok which is very good. One of our favorites is also the puto bumbong which is sticky rice and purple yam topped with butter, coconut shreds and if you like, sugar. They make this sooo well one piece is not enough. And lastly, we love their puto and sikwate. Mango added and its bomb!

Cafe laguna definitely knows that the way to a Pinoy's heart is to make his stomach happy!","","3","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=60"

It doesn't look like much: a sort of covered outdoor canteen with plastic chairs and a view of the parking lot. At the counter, you see fish, squid and prawns wrapped in cling wrap, and you're supposed to take a tray, open the transparent plastic partition that separates you from the seafood, and tong your fish directly onto it. There are colorful menus that allow you to choose typical Filipino dishes via their photos, and the first time I saw them I assumed that they had pulled the images off the internet.

Once you order, and surrender your tray of raw seafood to the staff behind the counter, you pick your table and wait for only 5-10 minutes until the food starts streaming out of the kitchen (and no, those photos were not pulled off the internet). Squid grilled to perfection, kinilaw (seafood ceviche in vinegar), grilled vegetables mixed with glass noodles, fried fish and steamed fish and grilled prawns and more fresh vegetables! I am always amazed to see what emerges from that kitchen.

To be enjoyed with a pitcher of the day's fresh juice (for example, watermelon-guava-apple), and raw baby chili in soy sauce (or not!).","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Fortuna, but visit their restaurant in SM Cebu City more often. This is the best sushi in Cebu. I am always completely satisfied and always rave how their sushi is always consistently fresh, delicious, and well prepared. My favorite is the chopped tuna sashimi. It's mixed with a creamy spicy sauce, small crispy bits of fried panko and green onions.  I've always loved the U.S. style Philadelphia Roll, a combination of Philadelphia cream cheese and salmon sashimi. Well, Nonki does is well with pieces of fresh mango.  I love it! I appreciate their prices, consistency, and fast service.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"

Restaurant is located inside SM Seaside in the Mountain Wing.

The soup takoyaki tasted like hush puppies and was equally crunchy. The soup to dip them in was on the salty side, not sure if thats how its suppose to be. My brother ordered some type of Osaka Burger, the poached egg was cooked well and tasted delightful. The curry was good, flavorful, but not spicy. If you are expecting green tea, they do not serve green tea. I found that kind of odd as normally Japanese themed restaurants normally have this as a staple and is regularly available. *shrugs* I did sample their takoyaki once before and they were delicious.

Staff: When we first entered it seemed as if all staff were in a meeting or training of some sort, this continued on during our meal but they vacated the remaining tables of the restaurant and continued behind us. You can hear the trainor say, ""the customer.. and when the customer.. You.."" We didn't linger after the meal but had we did this can easily turn annoying. Waitress who waited on us was polite. Food was of good temperature.

We paid about 600 pesos, I wanna say, for the 3 items.  Good place to snack, but needs more variety in their menu.","","5","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=120"

Very pleasant experience. Had the cappuccino, mango juice for my drinks. Clean and very trendy atmosphere. It's a bit pricey in my opinion for the locals. It's kind of hidden so you have to keep your eyes open finding this place if you're not familiar with the area. Great experience though for sure.","","",""

(FYI) Dont confuse this place as the one in Ayala Mall as this is their Buffet restaurant located at the Old Grand Convention Center.

They have a big parking lot which they share with 2 other restaurants within the building and a hall. I havent been here in years so when i came and saw they renovated the whole place, i really came to like it. Place is clean, fresh looking and modern.

I was surprised that they were really packed for lunch I even had to wait for them to refill some of the food because it was gone in minutes. They have a decent number of food available and taste was pretty good. Some of the ones that I liked included the Squid ala pobre, Scallops, fried fish, the bread( i forgot the name) and the ube cake for dessert. 

They also have a craving station, sushi area and noodle area. I tried the udon but i tasted too much garlic on my broth I didnt like it very much. Overall it was a good experience but does have some room for improvement.","","2","https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Cebu%20City%2C%20Cebu%2C%20Philippines&start=30"
