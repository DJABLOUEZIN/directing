This is my go to place for anything Dimsum...they serve the right condiment to compliment the dimsum (Finally a siopao sauce and Not Ketchup!!!) unlike any other dimsum places in the City. The congee, noodles and lechon macau is also my favorite and theyâ€™re pretty consistent with the food quality over the years too, and regardless of location."

I like their Vanilla Cake (Tres Leches Cake), and also their muffins and cookies. Definitely worth the price."

You have to try their lasagna and the chicken wings.\n\nAmbience- It actually feels so chill because of the hole in the wall and artisan vibe.They are expanding their store ao it is expected to accomodate more people."

Actually, not just the food. The place has great ambiance and the servers are very friendly and accommodating. The parking is limited though, and a bit elevated up front but you can park in the side street. I suppose a last resort option would be to try parking at Streetscape if it's really busy."

Comfort Room - their cr is not that clean, no water most of the time.\n2. Lavatory - for you to be able to savor your chicken wings, you'd want to eat it with your hands. Their sink is Okay but can can definitely be improved. They use pail to catch the dirty water and the water will definitely hit your leg, which is something not pleasant to a customer."

We got the Grande Cafe Americano and Sweet Cold Brew. Both tasted good and the price was okay. The cafe was artsy and had a relaxing atmosphere. The comfort room was clean and had everything you need (toilet paper, hand soap, paper towels, hand dryer). Right infront of the counter, they have an area with sugar, water, milk, trash can, etc. Overall, the cafe is a good place to gather for all occasions. Planning to visit again and try their meals."

I love the ambiance because it is by the sea, sad thing is that when we had supper there, there was no view anymore because it is dark.

The place - maybe adjust the aircon a little bit to make it comfortable especially when it's around lunch time. It was hot when we were there.\n2. Anti-mage iced tea - it did not taste like iced tea at all. It was water, sugar and some ice. It's not even cold.\n3. We had the Warlock's steak (more like tenderloin slices/ small pieces and not exactly a whole steak) - it took some time for them to serve it but it was not even close to warm when it was brought to our table. The serving portion is too small.\n4. Price - not worth the price at all. It's too expensive for a not cold iced tea, cold steak and...read more"

While there wasn't a lot of variety, the quality of the food available was good and consistent - which is pretty much what you ask for from a buffet\n\nIn particular, I loved the lechon belly, the grilling station (beef tenderloin, fish), the freshly baked pizza, the crepes, free flowing Heineken and the calamansi juice. The Japanese station was very sparse though - only maki was available. I'm usually used to a sashimi and tuna spread... Likewise, the fruits selection was great and super sweet.

The dough is very soft and the sweetness is just enough unlike its competition. The almonds and the white belgian chocolate combine with the donut gives a very pleasant taste.\nAbove it all they also have a very cozy place. Good for hang out or just relax while enjoying a bite of your donut."

Anti-mage iced tea - it did not taste like iced tea at all. It was water, sugar and some ice. It's not even cold.\n3. We had the Warlock's steak (more like tenderloin slices/ small pieces and not exactly a whole steak) - it took some time for them to serve it but it was not even close to warm when it was brought to our table. The serving portion is too small.\n4. Price - not worth the price at all. It's too expensive for a not cold iced tea, cold steak and...read more"

Ambience was really nice, good place to catch up.\n\nHowever, we waited for almost two hours for our food to be complete. One of my friends got irritated since when we first followed up for our order, we sensed that they have forgotten about it and told us to wait since the kitchen was busy. We waited for another hour for a salad and a breakfast plate. I think it would be wise if staff would actually write down the customer's orders instead of just memorizing it.\n\nIf not for the food, I would think twice on coming back here."

The Japanese station was very sparse though - only maki was available. I'm usually used to a sashimi and tuna spread... Likewise, the fruits selection was great and super sweet.
