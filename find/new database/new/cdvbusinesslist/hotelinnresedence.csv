The total charge for the two of us was ~15000 pesos. This included an aircon vehichle, a tour guide, entrance fee and lunch for both of us. We were under the impression that the submarine ride is the one that's increasing the price by so much( a city tour would have costed us ~3000 pesos) but upon our arrival we found that the submarine was actually costing 5000 pesos for two people only.The guide seemed to be uninformed of the places and failed to tell us the clear history of each monument. The city visit sites are all extremely close to each other and it absolutely did not make sense to us to pay so much for the tour, but we had already succumbed to the trap. Also at the start of the tour, we informed the guide that we are both vegetarians so our lunch should be vegetarian. But he took us to a seafood restaurant and then insisted that this is what we have. Then when we called the tour organizer she said that since we had not informed her about our vegetarian choice, we wont' be getting anything. After haggling so much we finally asked her to refund the money for lunch(initally she said 500 pesos for two which is extremely low, but finally we got her to agree to 1000 pesos for two ppl). Overall as tourists we feel cheated and mistreated. Highly disappointed. our overall philippines tour was excellent but i regret hiring them for our tour.""},{""reviewer_text"":""Dear KR Travel and Tours.and Employees,\n\n\n\nBeth and I would like to complement everyone on the splendid job you all did in organizing and running the tour we had the privilege in taking. It would be unfair to single out anyone in particular because everyone carried out their duties to a “five star” level. I cannot express to you how delighted we were in the tour itself and the organization behind it. To say it went off like clockwork would be an understatement. We have already recommended KR Travel and Tours to some off our friends and will continue to recommend the use of KR to anyone we know who may wish to visit the Philippines, and we will certainly use KR again in the future.Please feel free to use or quote us in any advertising or promotional way in order to enhance KR Travel and Tours.\n\n\n\nOnce again many thanks for a fantastic time.\n\n\n\nS & B Carr\n\nSydney Australia""}]","Available Package Tours & Private Tours Everyday at:

It was indeed peaceful and quiet and out of the way and off the beaten path. There were no crowds there and no noise. The rooms were clean and price was low. The staff was helpful and friendly and the food was delicious. Not a lot of white sand at the beach, but it was exactly like in the pictures, so I wasn't disappointed. The website and the menu said to put in your order early as they do not have any items pre-prepared and everything is made fresh. Only took about 20 minutes so that was great.
