I like their Vanilla Cake (Tres Leches Cake), and also their muffins and cookies. Definitely worth the price."

You have to try their lasagna and the chicken wings.\n\nAmbience- It actually feels so chill because of the hole in the wall and artisan vibe.They are expanding their store ao it is expected to accomodate more people."

Actually, not just the food. The place has great ambiance and the servers are very friendly and accommodating. The parking is limited though, and a bit elevated up front but you can park in the side street. I suppose a last resort option would be to try parking at Streetscape if it's really busy."

We got the Grande Cafe Americano and Sweet Cold Brew. Both tasted good and the price was okay. The cafe was artsy and had a relaxing atmosphere. The comfort room was clean and had everything you need (toilet paper, hand soap, paper towels, hand dryer). Right infront of the counter, they have an area with sugar, water, milk, trash can, etc. Overall, the cafe is a good place to gather for all occasions. Planning to visit again and try their meals."
